Like 10 years ago, buying low-mid tier phone would get you into so many bottlenecks that you would want to throw the phone out the window when there's not enough space to even install discord and browser would lag opening new tab, but nowdays, even low-mid tier stuff is more than useable. I got myself ROG phone 5. Reasonings are that it has enough specs to run everything I want to run on it, triggers on phone itself and game overlay with useful features, headphone jack with front facing super loud stereo speakers, flat screen with no notches or holepunches, battery that lasts for two days, enough space for everything, etc. etc. and also money wasn't an issue.

Additionally staff can't make exceptions every single time it's artist posting or waste hours on responding to passive aggressive blips and dmails about how they somehow have personal vendetta againts artist and how artist will now full on quit because of them.

You can try to massage prostate specifically, some can even get multiple handsfree orgasms with prostate stimulators, but even that's down to individuals and many can't do that.
