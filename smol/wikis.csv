breast_padding,"Padding that enhances [[breast]] size, typically shaped to fit inside a bra or under clothing. Also known as falsies, jellies, or bust enhancements.

This tag can refer to the breast pads themselves, other non-purpose-made objects being used to pad the breasts, the action of padding the breasts even if the pads aren't visible, or the concept of padding the breasts even when they aren't being padded.

h4. Not to be confused with:
* [[fake breasts]] - Fake, often ridiculous objects stuffed into clothes to give the appearance of larger breasts
* [[breast implants]] - Surgically implanted, often spherical enhancements to breasts; should only be tagged with sufficient evidence or when the assumption is reasonable

hair_ring,"thumb #261607 thumb #316630 thumb #356200

A [[ring]] used to hold a lock of [[hair]] together. It may be plain metal (often shiny, but it doesn't [i]have[/i] to be), or have engraved markings in the metal, jewel(s) on the metal, etc.

If the hair itself is formed into a loop or ring shape, without using a metal ring, [[hair_bow]], or other [[hair_accessory]], use `hair_loop` instead - example ""here"":/posts/1521893.

blingee,"Blingee is a website that allows people to add some spice to their pictures with various overlays such as animated sparkles, catchphrases, animated text, borders, and particle effects, among other embellishments.

The site was very popular during the late 2000’s period, and was a hallmark of that era of internet culture. The distinct visual style has been integrated into certain visual aesthetics, cultures, and fashion aesthetics such as the [[scene_girl|scene]] movement, [[lolcats]] memes, on people’s profiles of early internet blogging sites, and as celebrity fan content.
