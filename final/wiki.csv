yellow_inner_pussy,"thumb #2139245

This refers to the fleshy region that makes up the inner part of a [[pussy]] that is the color yellow.

[section,expanded=Anatomy included]

Representations of flesh may also be tagged as [[yellow_flesh]].

* [[Clitoris]] - More specially [[yellow_clitoris]]
* Labia minora (inner labia) - The labia folds that occupy the space in between the labia majora (outer labia) in a [[humanoid pussy]].
** An [[equine pussy]] also features an inner labia, but it is not always drawn as distinct from the outer labia.

Sometimes the inner part of the outer labia will show a flesh color to establish the inner region. This color is likely safe to treat as an inner region color.

h6. Internal anatomy (vagina, reproductive organs)

Flesh that is part of internal anatomy structures

For tagging purposes, the surface of the vaginal canal should not use flesh color tags. If possible to distinguish, the region inside the vaginal canal is probably best to be treated as a separate region to the inner pussy. Even though the clitoris may sometime extend from this anatomy, it probably makes sense to include it as part of the inner pussy in most cases.

[u]Consider using the following tags to describe internal regions:[/u]

* [[yellow_insides]] - This refers to any internal region of the body, including the vaginal canal.
* [[yellow_vaginal_canal]] - This tag could exist as an alternative to describing the vaginal canal color with the more flesh-focused inner pussy color tags.

The color of the inner pussy may be the same color as the vaginal canal. In such a case, the color tags for both regions are applicable.

Wanda is a shapely saluki with a shiny coat that is mostly brown with the exception of her belly, chest and muzzle, which are white. Her tail and ears have longer hair than the rest of her body and she has large brown and expressive eyes which she uses to help get what she wants
Personality

In the beginning, Wanda is seemingly focused on having an advantage towards a more comfortable living and using male dogs who can give her that advantage. Tyson gave her protection and dating him gave her a little more freedom than other dogs in the shelter. Later, she charms Rex in order to leave the shelter for ""velvet pillows"".

Wanda seems to change throughout the movie, forming a romantic interest with Rex and genuinely caring for his well being and happiness. "
piledriver_position,"thumb #545364 thumb #720519 thumb #3281256

The [b]piledriver position[/b] is a sexual position named after the downward motion of a pile driver device (the wrestling move with same name was coined much later). The position is executed with the bottom partner lying neck down and bottom up with their legs bent over head, while the top partner [[crouching|crouches]] over them and inserts their penis or [[strapon]] straight downwards.

When the bottom character is instead penetrating the top character (as might happen with [[female on top]]), this position becomes the [[amazon position]]. 

A softer position, where the thrusting motion is more horizontal than vertical, and the bottom has more than just shoulders on the ground is the [[anvil_position]].

game_cartridge,"thumb #463208 thumb #314932

A [b]game cartridge[/b] (abbreviated ""cart"") is a data storage medium similar to a flash drive, but requiring a dedicated access port. A cartridge is the Read-Only Memory device holding the game data (and perhaps a few secondary microchips, up to and including a RAM stack), and is slotted into the top of a [[console]]. The device may be designed to not fit into a slot of a different console (a [[Nintendo]] cartridge will not fit into a [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] slot, for example, nor will a [[NeoGeo]] cart fit into a [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] slot).

Carts were largely phased out in favor of CD-ROM discs, and later DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, for reasons of storage capacity (one CD can hold a hundred games it takes an entire cartridge to store) and cost (a cartridge requires several expensive components to manufacture, leading to games that cost 40-50% more than CD games, which simply require a single piece of plastic). However, cartridges had a loading time measured in microseconds (due to their solid-state construction) and no DRM (as nobody outside the manufacturers had the machinery necessary to write blank carts; nor could a cart be re-purposed — except, perhaps, as a coaster or paperweight—once written).

The [[Game Boy]] series of hand-held consoles never split from carts.

The [[Nintendo Switch]] also uses a modernized form of cartridges (Save-Data or SD cards), due to their fast loading times, while still having games on-par with its contemporaries in terms of both length and graphics.

Nutty is one of the main characters of [[Happy Tree Friends]].

Nutty is a light green squirrel with a yellow diamond-shaped marking on his head and a large curled-up tail that moves when he is excited. Nutty has an addiction for candy or anything that is sugary. He has a big swirly lollipop, candy cane, small all-day sucker, and a candy apple stuck to his fur. It is apparent that his googly eye is an amblyopia, or lazy eye, however, he seems to be able to control it, usually whenever he looks at an object intently. As a result of his huge sugar intake, Nutty is often hyperactive and jittery, and giggles more than he talks.

dark_magician,"thumb #173533

[b]Dark Magician[/b], known as [b]Black Magician[/b] (ブラック・マジシャン, Burakku Majishan) in the Japanese versions, is a character and [[duel monster]] in the [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]] games and anime franchise along with being one of its most iconic monsters. He is the quintessential component of the [b]Dark Magician Archetype[/b] deck, for which the archetype is named after and centers around.

Unlike his student/lover [[Dark Magician Girl]], Dark Magician's appearance has changed numerous times over the years as the anime and game has evolved. Dark Magician is usually depicted as a lean young man with long blonde hair and an angular face with a calm expression. He wears a dark colored robe over a bodysuit with light armor around his arms and legs, shoulder pads, a pointy hat, and a cowl. In his hand he holds a long scepter with a sharp end and a crystal ball on the end of it. Dark Magician's outfit has a motif of layering and spiraling which is present in almost every single article of clothing and item he carries.

Dark Magician has gone through numerous pallet swaps. His original design was peach skin, purple hair, and purple clothing, with a green scepter. Since then his skin has been green, brown, blue, white. His hair has been blonde or white. His clothing has been blue, black or red. His scepter has been green or colored to match his clothes.

Dark Magician is a Level 7, Dark-Attribute, Spellcaster/Normal Monster. By default it has 2500 Attack Points and 2100 Defense Points. It requires two monster card to be tributed to her before it can be normal summoned. It facilitates the summoning and use of numerous other Dark Spellcaster Cards such as Dark Sage, Dark Magician Girl, The Magician of Black Chaos, Dark Paladin, and Dark Magician Knight.

According to the protagonist of the original [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]], [[Yugi Muto]], Dark Magician is his most favorite, most powerful, and most rare card in his entire deck and his most frequently played card throughout the series."

command,"thumb #3581252

A [b]command[/b] is a directive statement, or [[text]] / [[pictographics]] / [[gesture]] / or audio that can reasonably be interpreted to function as a directive. A directive is an instruction to complete a task, or objective. Commands are commonplace in everyday speech habits, being one of the primary ways we convey wants and needs to each other.

Commands do not necessarily have to target another character, and may even appear in [[inner monologue]]. This is due to characters sometimes expressing their needs internally.

h4. Command influence

Commands can exude a positive, or negative influence depending on context, and phrasing.

h5. Positive influence

A command issued as a suggestion, request, praise, or as words of [[encouragement]]. These commands are either asking for something in a mostly polite way, or are attempting to guide, or help someone complete a task or objective. The latter can be considered as a form of moral support. See [[cheering]].

Requests may be in the form of a [[question]], which makes it an interrogative statement rather than an imperative (command) statement. The format shouldn't matter too much as long as there is a directive being conveyed. 

h5. Negative influence

A command issued with authority, or with intent to threaten. These commands are more commonly referred to as orders. There may be consequences if an order is not followed.

h4. Command affirmation

Commands can tell you to do something (affirmative), or not to do something (negative).

h4. Terms

* [b]Direct command[/b] - A direct command (order) is a type of command with an unconditional expectation that the command will be followed. 
* [b]Passive command[/b] - A passive (idle) command is a type of command that has no expectations that it will be followed.

Vaporeon, known as the Bubble Jet [[Pokémon]], is one of the evolutions of [[Eevee]] that is caused by radiation from a Water Stone. Vaporeon's body is light-blue and has a white collar; it has yellow ears made of webbing and a fin on its head resembling ears, and a pointed pattern of dark blue on its head that encompasses the backs of its ears and head-fin. It also has blue ridges that run down the length of its spine and on to its tail-fin, and the paw pads on its hind feet are dark blue like the ridges.

Vaporeon's molecular structure is close to water, and because of this, Vaporeon are highly adapted to aquatic life. It can manipulate water molecules, melt into water, walk on water, and breathe underwater. Many people who first see this Pokémon believe it is a mermaid. When Vaporeon's fins begin to vibrate, it is said to be a sign that rain will come within a few hours. Vaporeon are always found close to water, and prefer large, clean lakes.

An intense form of [[french kissing]]. This generally involves [[long_tongue|long tongues]] and an excessive amount of [[saliva]] and [[drooling]]. Sometimes it can just be a really bizarre time to be french kissing someone.

A 23 year old raccoon hailing from Vista, California. He served for three years as an aviator for the United States Army. He received an honorable discharge in 2039 at the age of 20 following a helicopter crash that took his left arm. 
[quote]h2.EARLY LIFE
Born on September 16th, 2019, he was raised in several places throughout California, before finally settling in Vista.[/quote]
[quote]h2.MILITARY SERVICE
At the age of 17, Ashton joined into the United States Army to become a warrant aviation officer. Throughout his service, he flew a UH-6o Blackhawk during the ongoing Slavic War, primarily in Old Ukraine. His primary objectives mainly consisted of assaulting enemy convoys, and regular patrol recon. 

At the tail end of his career, he was shot down along with all five of his crew approximately 60 miles behind enemy lines. However, due to not only his piloting during the crash, but his after-incident first aid and quick thinking, all crew survived. He lead the group back to the FOB from which they'd departed, carrying three crew members whom had lost consciousness in the crash, and scouting multiple high-value targets on their way. For this, he was awarded the distinguished service cross.[/quote]

ghoul_(h.p._lovecraft),"========
https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Ghoul
========
Ghouls are a species of cannibalistic humanoids featured in several of Lovecraft's works.

They are first depicted in the short story ""Pickman's Model"", where the eponymous main character meets with the beings regularly to paint them in various poses and activities. It is revealed in ""The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"" that Pickman is in fact a partial or full-blooded ghoul, and now resides with them in the Dreamlands as a chieftain.

In combat, they are known to use items such as headstones and were unfamiliar with other types of weaponry up until their battle with the Moon-beasts. It was here that they first discovered, and quickly mastered, the use of spears and of javelins. With this newfound technology, they were able to annihilate the garrison of Moon-beasts on the nameless rock off the coast of Sarkomand in the Dreamlands.

On specific planets they worship a number of gods such as Baoht Z'uqqa-mogg (""Mysterious Manuscripts"" RPG Module by Thomas M. K. Stratman) or Mordiggian (""The Charnel God"" by Clark Ashton Smith).

[b]Pokémon-Amie[/b] (Japanese: ポケパルレ Poké Parler) is a feature introduced in [[pokemon|Pokémon]] X and Y that allows the player to develop stronger bonds with their Pokémon. It uses the touch screen to allow players to pet, feed, and play with Pokémon currently on their team. Players may interact with their Pokémon by petting or feeding them via the touchscreen or mimicking their movements using the camera. Large Pokémon, like Tyranitar and Snorlax, take up both screens of the 3DS.

Pokémon-Amie introduces three new interrelated statistics for the player to manage: affection, fullness, and enjoyment. Interacting with a Pokémon or feeding it increases its affection towards the player, which grants bonuses such as allowing it to avoid attacks and land critical hits more often. Note that affection is separate from friendship.

Pokémon-Amie is accessible among the paged features on the bottom screen of the 3DS, immediately left of Super Training or right of the Player Search System. In Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, these are all found in the PlayNav of the PokéNav Plus.

minerva_mink,"Thumb #2877199

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Animaniacs_characters#Minerva_Mink

""Minerva Mink – An attractive anthropomorphic mink, voiced by Julie Brown, with the ability to seduce and charm any and every male creature around her into the state of a babbling idiot, often inducing Tex Avery-esque wild takes. Just as every male creature lusts after Minerva, she lusts after every handsome looking male she sees and goes crazy when she sees one. She has a loose attitude and behaves like a primadonna. She was named Marilyn Mink in pre-production.

She starred in the least number of shorts of all the ensemble cast, allegedly because the content of her episodes was so overtly sexual that it was decided that it would be inappropriate for the intended predominantly young audience.

Both Minerva and Newt appeared in several issues of the Animaniacs comic book (with Minerva's sexuality a bit watered down, but Newt still his ever-blundering self). She also appears in Wakko's Wish as an ensemble member, but has a couple solo lines to herself.""

In fan art, Minerva is sometimes seen in a romantic/sexual relationship with [[wilford_wolf|Wilford Wolf]].

sliver_(magic:_the_gathering),"A species of creature from the card game Magic: The Gathering. Slivers come in 2 general forms, a serpentine form, and a humanoid form. The vast majority of sliver are serpent-like, but there are some that are humanoid. The serpent-like slivers always have at least one arm that ends in a long sharp claw and have a head with a similar shape. In addition, the bodies of these sliver split into multiple tail like tentacles at the base, which allows them to move how they do. The humanoid slivers can be distinguished from other humanoid by the presence of tentacle like appendages on the body. These are most commonly located on the head, resembling hair, but can be located in other places."

oni,"[[Oni]] are a kind of yōkai from Japanese folklore, variously translated as Japanese type [[demon]]s and devils. 

Depictions of oni vary widely but usually portray them as hideous, gigantic ogre-like creatures with sharp claws, wild hair, and two long horns growing from their heads. They are humanoid for the most part, but occasionally, they are shown with unnatural features such as odd numbers of eyes or extra fingers, toes or horns on their head. Their skin may be any number of colors, but red, blue and black are particularly common. They are often depicted wearing tiger-skin loincloths and carrying iron clubs, called [[kanabō]]


They are popular characters in Japanese art, literature and theatre.

The hierophant's free hand gestures towards the earth and the heavens with two fingers each.

In cartomancy, the upright Hierophant arcanum is interpreted as spiritual wisdom, religious belief, conformity, tradition, and institutions.
The reversed Hierophant arcanum is interpreted as personal belief, freedom, and challenging the status quo.

[/section]

h4. Introduction to forms [[#top|^]][#formintro]

The default, or standardized spelling of a sound effect is known as the base form for that sound effect. An alternate spelling of a base form is known as a modified form.

Modified form tags may be found [[#forms|here]]. Detailed explanations on usage may be found in their respective wikis.

h4. How to identify sound effects [[#top|^]][#identification]

Sound effects represent actions, sounds, and often both.

* Look for isolated text near characters or objects, and determine its purpose.
* Artists will often format sound effects, and vocalizations differently than [[dialogue]]. Look for differences in how the text looks.
* Sound effects may also be [[sound_effects_in_dialogue|embedded in the dialogue itself]]. It does not matter where the artist puts the sound effect, this tag can still be used. 

[section=Onomatopoeia identification] [[#top|^]][#onomatopoeia]

[[Onomatopoeia]] are sound effects that resemble or are based on words.

For tagging purposes, a word includes dictionary words (""Buzz"", ""Huff"", ""Lick"", ""Twitch""), slang words (""Plap"", ""Shlick""), constructed or modified words (""Glorp"", ""Shlop"", ""Splurt"", ""Thoom""), and multiple word sound effects (""Horny squeak""). The subject matter of the word doesn't matter (though be careful with tagging vocalizations). Most words can theoretically function as an onomatopoeia.

h4. Tagging criteria

Use the following criteria to determine if a sound effect is an onomatopoeia.

* Many vocalizations do not count as sound effects. For exceptions, see [i]Vocalizations[/i] section.
* Most [[animal noises]], and [[breathing noises]] in their proper forms count as onomatopoeia.
* [[Vowelless]] forms are [u]never[/u] onomatopoeia.
** They may not always qualify as sound effects either. The ones that do fall under [[vowelless_sound_effect]].
* The form is not excessively garbled (contains random, non-sensible letters).
* The form is a fully formed word, formed with [[multi-word_onomatopoeia|multiple words]], or appears like it could pass off as a word.
** Onomatopoeia may contain [[extended_sound_effect|extra letters than it should have]] (""Mooo"", ""Riiip"", ""Sluurrrp""), but should not be tagged when the form is missing letters that it should have (""Bzzz"", ""Gurgl"", ""Swsh"").
** Alternate spellings are usually okay to tag as onomatopoeia (""Slurk"", ""Shlurk"", and ""Schlurk"" are all onomatopoeia).

[/section]

[section=Vocalization identification]

A [[vocalization]] is a sound, or representation of a sound, that is vocalized (produced by vocal chords), but does not form proper words (would not fit into a speech theme such as [[dialogue]], or [[inner_monologue]]). 

* By default vocalizations [u]do not[/u] qualify as sound effects, with the exception being those that are represented by onomatopoeic words.
** If the term is better described as a [[grunting|grunt]], [[laugh]], or [[moan]], the `sound_effects` tag probably doesn't apply. Literal representation of vocalizations count as both (such as ""Giggle"" in the example below).

h4. Example

thumb #3465882

* Most [[animal noises]] (""Chirp"", ""Meow"", ""Woof"", etc) function the same way being both onomatopoeia, and vocalizations.

[/section]

h4. How to tag sound effects [[#top|^]][#howtotag]

h6. Knowing common synonyms can be helpful

* Action sound effects are often stored in umbrella tags for a common action. See [[pulling_sound_effect]]
** Actions that do not have their own dedicated sound effect tag (i.e. [[throbbing]]) are usually stored in a sound effect umbrella category based on the nature of the sound.

For a list of examples, see [[#categories|Sound categories]]

h6. Use the site's tag autocomplete to make finding tags easy

* The common form can often be found by typing the unknown sound effect into the tag box and seeing what pops up.
** Modified spellings are usually still stored in the base form. Do not worry too much if there are extra, or missing letters.
** Vowel shifts are often stored in a single tag for simplicity.

h4. Examples

[quote]
* Use [[splurt]] to represent both ""Splrt"", and ""Splurrt"".
* Use [[bwomp]] to represent both ""Bwump"" and ""Bwomph"". Do note that [[fwomp]] is a different form.
[/quote]

h6. Check the tag group

For a mostly complete list, see [[tag_group:sound_effects]].

h4. Action tagging [[#top|^]][#actiontagging]

[i]This section describes how to tag actions when there are sound effects present.[/i]

h6. Identify the purpose

* Ask yourself if the form represents contact, movement, or something else, and determine what action is being represented.

h6. Tagging guidelines

* Action tags may be tagged based on sound effect usage in most cases.
** Complex actions such as [[sex]] are not taggable if they are offscreen, but most lewd noises can be tagged in any situation.

* A sound effect can be associated with several action concepts that are related in an artistic sense, but not a tagging sense.

h4. Example

This image shows a kissing, and a swallowing sound effect being used as an interpretive mechanic. For the sake of simplicity, sound effect concepts can be used in a literal, or interpretive application.

thumb #2390655 This should neither be tagged as [[kissing]], or [[swallowing]], but it still contains a [[kissing_sound_effect|kissing]], and [[swallowing sound effect]].

h4. Creating new tags [[#top|^]][#newtags]

Factors that should be considered before starting a new sound effect tag:

* Does a tag already exist? 
** Keep in mind that the tag used to store a sound effect may not be spelled the same as it appears in an image. Lookup tables are provided in the [[tag_group:sound_effects|tag group]] if unsure.

[section=Tag name criteria]
 
* Choose an appropriate tag format. See [[#tagformat|Tag formats]] 
* Avoid using a non-standardized spelling as the tag name.

[/section]

[section,expanded=General guidelines]

A sound effect form may receive a dedicated tag if:

* It consists of a form that does not seem like a one-off usage for a particular image, or used exclusively by a single artist, who is likely intentionally trying to be unique through their sound effect usage. Try to identify relevant base  forms that have a more common usage instead.
* It is a dictionary word. Artists cannot claim sole usage to a word they didn't invent. It is generally okay to create tags for sound effects based on real words even if the subject matter is obscure or not drawn very often.
** If it is a verb, or closely related to a verb or action, consider if it should be part of an action sound effect tag. One may already exist!
** An action sound effect of the form `<verb>ing_sound_effect` has the added benefit of including synonyms to that action in the tag that would not be included if the base form was used instead.
** Some sound effect forms get stored in action tags instead for convenience, this is especially true for pure onomatopoeic concepts such as [[clicking]] and [[buzzing]].

Avoid creating new tags that are too similar to existing sound effects tags. You may be dealing with a derived form, and derived forms are usually stored in the tag for the base form. Dedicated tags for derived forms should be created sparingly.

It is recommended that you try to fill in a new tag with at least a few entries if you are going to make one.

h4. Advanced techniques [[#top|^]][#lettershiftintro]

[section=Introduction to Letter shifting]

[b]Letter shifting[/b] refers to a phenomena where the base spelling of a sound effect is modified to produce a different phonetic sound while the usage of the sound effect remains identical. Vowel shifts tend to end up stored under a common tag, while consonant shifts tend to be stored as separate tags. Whether or not similarly spelled terms should be kept separate, or combined depends on several factors including how each sound effect tends to be used. A shift in this context refers to one letter, being swapped out for another letter.

h4. How to handle letter shifts

* The best method of handling letter shifts is to use the site's autocomplete. Most of these letter shifted terms have preexisting tags.
* If it looks like a sound is a variation of another form, it probably is.

h4. Lookup table (Under construction)

This table contains established tags for various letter shift forms.

[#faq]
[section=Frequently Asked Questions]

[quote]
[i]Q. Why is sound effect tagging important?[/i]

[i]A. There are two methods artists use to depict actions in a static image. An action may be depicted using visual details, or by using effects (such as motion, and sound effects). Sound effect tags allow users to find actions that are based on visual details, based on sound effects, or a mixture of both. Often just pairing an action tag with the sound effects base tag will produce unpredictable results.[/i]

[i]There are more reasons than that:[/i]

[i]- Sound effects are a major form of narrative element that influences how images are tagged.
- Tag navigation is improved when organization is improved. Not all sound effects are created equal, and some hide the presence of other sound effects quite effectively.
- Some users love images with lots of sound effects in them, while others prefer to keep things simple, and uncluttered. People are different.

[/i]

[/quote]

[quote]
[i]Q. Why vowelless?[/i]

[i]A. Vowelless is a distinct form of sound effect, and the most recognizable example of approximated sounds. There are sound effects that are exclusively vowelless, and many forms are too inconsistent to have dedicated sound effect tags on their own, so it only makes sense to have a place for these tags. Additionally, there is a lesser known theme known as a vocalization that also commonly produces vowelless forms. These forms rarely get treated as sound effects, and users should know how to tell vowelless forms apart. See [[vowelless]] for more information.[/i]

Trinity is the name of a dragon who gave her soul to be used to enchant a shield of draconic make. The process made the shield and her soul near indestructible, and empowered it with morphing and the elemental control of ice. 

The most notable image though, is the physical manifestation the shield forms in the shape of a female dragon. With this disposable and modifiable form, it interacts with others.

them's_fightin'_herds,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them%27s_Fightin%27_Herds

""Them's Fightin' Herds is an indie fighting game developed by Mane6 and published by Maximum Games. Atypical of most side-scrolling fighting games, it features a cast of all-female ungulate characters fighting each other to find a champion worthy of gaining a magical key that will protect their world from predators. First released into early access in February 2018, the full release was on April 30, 2020 for Microsoft Windows, followed by Linux on March 25, 2021 and a beta macOS version was added on October 27, 2021. The game was released for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 5]], [[Xbox One]], and Xbox Series X/S on October 18, 2022.

The project is a spiritual successor to Mane6's original planned fighting game Fighting Is Magic based on the animated television show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. Mane6 was a team of nine developers and part of the adult fandom of the show. Fighting Is Magic featured the six main pony characters from that show. Early versions of this game were released in 2012, drawing attention from both players in the Evolution Championship Series due to the unique moves associated with non-bipedal characters in fighting games, as well as from Hasbro which owned the intellectual property to My Little Pony. After Hasbro sent Mane6 a cease and desist letter, Mane6 discarded the assets tied to the show, while keeping some of the fundamental gameplay factors to create the new title Them's Fightin' Herds. The creator of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, Lauren Faust, offered to help with designing the new characters for the game. The development of the game was completed with crowdfunding through Indiegogo.

Them's Fightin' Herds is a fighting game based on sapient four-legged hoofed creatures from the world of Fœnum, which is being threatened by the return of carnivorous beasts known as the Predators. The Predators were locked away in a separate realm, but they have found a way to escape it. To put an end to the threat, selected champions of the various Fœnum races are chosen as ""Key Seekers"" by their tribes to find the key that will lock the Predators away again. The Key Seekers must face each other in a friendly competition to determine which one will be the Key Keeper who will face the champion of the Predators.

There are six playable characters—[[Arizona_cow_(tfh)|Arizona the cow]] (voiced by Tara Strong), [[Velvet_reindeer_(tfh)|Velvet the reindeer]] (Tia Ballard), [[Paprika_paca_(tfh)|Paprika the alpaca]] (Marieve Herington), [[Oleander_(tfh)|Oleander the unicorn]] (Alexa Kahn) who can summon a demonic being known as [[fhtng_the_unspeakable|""Fred""]] (Keith Ferguson), [[Pom_(tfh)|Pom the sheep]] (Allie Moreno) and [[Tianhuo_(tfh)|Tianhuo the longma]] (Kay Bess)—each with different fighting move sets and unique movement options such as flight, short hops, double jumps, or air dashes. Jessica Gee voices the game's announcer. A seventh playable character, pirate goat [[Shanty_(tfh)|Shanty]] (Afi Ekulona), was also released as downloadable content due to the crowdfunding campaign reaching its stretch goals; she was later included in the base roster for the console versions. Additional characters are planned for release via a season pass, including Arizona's bull father [[Texas_(tfh)|Texas]] (Patrick Seitz) and three others.

momo_(creepypasta),"Momo is the nickname given to a sculpture created by a Japanese special effects company. (""Link Factory"")
The spread of Momo as a creepypasta icon seems to stem from rumors of a mysterious ""WhatsApp"" number sending disturbing images to those who try to contact it.
[section=Momo's Avian Features]
1) Her mouth seems to come to a point, somewhat resembling a beak.
2) Her arms/hands are covered in rough skin like that of many birds' feet.
3) Her long nails look like talons.
4) Since the sculpture only has half of a body, she is shown to walk with her bird-like arms/hands, making the resemblance to a bird even more obvious.[/section]"

mr._mime,"[b]Mr. Mime[/b] (Japanese: バリヤード Barrierd).  #122 in the National Pokédex, classified as the Barrier [[Pokémon (species)|Pokémon]].  It is a dual-type Psychic/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation I: [i]Pokémon Red[/i] and [i]Blue[/i]. Prior to Generation VI, it was a pure Psychic-type Pokémon.

It evolves from [[Mime Jr]]. when leveled up while knowing Mimic.

In Galar, [[Galarian_Mr._Mime|Mr. Mime has an Ice/Psychic-type regional form]]. It evolves into [[Mr. Rime]] starting at level 42. All Mime Jr. in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.

Mr. Mime is a [[bipedal]], [[humanoid]] [[Pokémon]]. Blue growths resembling [[clown]] hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips.

From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. Mr. Mime is usually very rare, but can be found in suburban areas. In the past, Substitute was its signature move.

new_moomin,"[b][i]New Moomin[/i][/b] (新ムーミン, [i]Shin Mūmin[/i]) is the second of three [[anime]] series based on Tove Jansson's [i][[the_moomins|Moomin]][/i] books. It is a remake of the first [i]Moomin[/i] anime, aired from 1969 to 1970

Like its predecessor series, it was produced without the involvement of Tove Jansson, who did not approve of its production; on her request, the series was broadcasted exclusively in Japan and Taiwan and has never been released elsewhere. It is more faithful to the [i]Moomin[/i] books than the 1969 series, but takes certain liberties with character designs that are not reflected in future official media (e.g. [[Snufkin]] wearing a yellow shirt and orange hat instead of his official green shirt and hat).

[i]New Moomin[/i] would be followed in 1990 by another anime simply titled [i][[moomin_(1990_anime)|Moomin]][/i], produced with Tove Jansson's involvement and broadcasted worldwide."
waving_at_viewer,"thumb #2705508 thumb #1512259 thumb #3063546

When a character is [[waving]] directly at [i]you[/i], the viewer.

This is opposed to the character waving to another visible in the scene, or waving while facing away from the viewer at a potentially off screen, or entirely [[unseen character]] out of frame.  Waving at the viewer almost inherently also involves [[looking at viewer]], and may also involve [[talking to the viewer]]. 

Waving at viewer [b]SHOULD NOT[/b] be applied to a ""shot/reverse shot"":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot/reverse_shot - where the character is shown, followed by a panel (in a comic) or shot (in an animation), where a second character is shown waving towards the fourth wall, at that now unseen first character, and so is only indirectly waving at the viewer.

jojo's_bizarre_adventure,"""[b][i]JoJo's Bizarre Adventure[/i][/b] (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by [[Hirohiko Araki]]. It was originally serialized in Shueisha's [i]shōnen[/i] manga magazine [i]Weekly Shōnen Jump[/i] from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly [i]seinen[/i] manga magazine [i]Ultra Jump[/i] in 2005. The series is divided into nine story arcs, each following a new protagonist bearing the ""JoJo"" nickname. The first six parts form a saga detailing the supernatural conflicts between members of the Joestar family and various villains, while the latter parts follow a continuity reboot, taking place in an alternate universe with plot parallels to the original. [i]JoJo's Bizarre Adventure[/i] is Shueisha's largest ongoing manga series by volume count, with its chapters collected in 131 [i]tankōbon[/i] volumes as of September 2021.

A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, [i]Stardust Crusaders[/i], was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, [i]Phantom Blood[/i], which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting [i]Phantom Blood[/i] and [i]Battle Tendency[/i] began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of December 2021, the studio has produced five seasons adapting through the manga's sixth part, [i]Stone Ocean[/i]. A live-action film based on the fourth part, [i]Diamond Is Unbreakable[/i], was released in Japan in 2017.

[i]JoJo's Bizarre Adventure[/i] is well-known for its art style and poses; frequent references to Western popular music and fashion; and battles centered around [[stand_(jjba)|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations with unique supernatural abilities. The series had over 120 million copies in circulation as of December 2021, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history, and it has spawned a media franchise including one-shot manga, light novels, video games, action figures, and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.""

[b]Building insertion[/b] describes scenes where a [[macro]] sized character is shown inserting a [[building]] into an orifice — typically the vagina or anus — for the purposes of [[masturbation]]. 

This often involves the character [[kneeling]] or [[crouching]] over an appropriately phallic building and lowering themselves onto it; alternatively, the character may uproot the building entirely, and use it as an [[improvised sex toy]]. In either case, these scenes usually involve [[building destruction]] of the inserted structure, and result in the destruction of the immediate surroundings, [[city destruction|potentially the entire city]] if the character is large enough.

the_great_gonzales_jr,"While Mario, Goombella, Koops and Flurrie are competing as pro fighters in Glitzville's Glitz Pit, they find that one of the fighting teams, the Armored Harriers, seem to be impervious to any attack they use. At an earlier time, Mario had found a Yoshi Egg bouncing around, being chased by the owner of the Hot Dog Stand, Mr. Hoggle (who had hopes of making a Southern Fried Egg Dog of Tastiness with it). Mario eventually caught it, and Mr. Hoggle allowed him to keep it as most people ""don't like to eat things that move"". 

After Mario returns from his problematic battle with the Armored Harriers, the egg hatches into a spunky Yoshi child who thanks Mario. He then joins Mario (who he knows as [b]The Great Gonzales[/b]; his fighter alias), who proceeds to name him. The Yoshi kid can defeat the Armored Harriers by eating them and spitting them at each other. He travels with Mario for the rest of the game.

At the end of the adventure, he goes solo at the Glitz Pit, going under the name ""[b]The Great Gonzales Jr.[/b]"", and is stated to be getting close to the title match. In Goombella's letter, the Yoshi challenges The Great Gonzales by saying ""I could totally take you in the ring now, so bring it!"". 

He is notable for calling Mario ""Gonzales"" throughout the entire course of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (in a manner similar to other non-player characters such as Goldbob and his family); his odd familiarity with this name is only due to the fact that Mario took up the pseudonym (upon Grubba's insistence) while fighting in the Glitz Pit. By the end of the game, though, Yoshi would appear to have slowly realized that Gonzales' real name was Mario, but he states that Mario will always be Gonzales to him."

torture,"[b]Torture[/b] is the infliction of great physical [[pain]], or [[suffering]] of a character by another character typically for reasons such as [[sadism]], or [[extortion]]. Common forms of torture such as waterboarding (water torture) can directly use this tag as long as a character is experiencing it. Although [[imminent_torture]] may sometimes apply.

Not all acts of extreme trauma should be considered as torture, as the theme involves a deliberate act to cause suffering. Situations that are incidental, or otherwise, where a character experiences intense pain should be tagged as [[suffering]].

Some forms of torture, especially those involving [[peril]], can evoke mental suffering. Situations that involve extreme fear, and risk of dying may also qualify as torture even if the character hasn't experienced any pain yet.

A character who receives pleasure from causing the suffering of others is known as a [[sadism|sadist]]. Conversely, a character who receives pleasure from suffering is known as a [[masochism|masochist]].

A fictional character from the anime series [i]Tenchi Muyo![/i] and its subsequent spinoffs.  Human in appearance, Sasami is actually a member of a race of powerful beings known as the Jurai and is a princess of her people along with her older sister Ayeka.  Sasamii has teal-colored hair usually tied in long pigtails with melon pink eyes. In the [i]Tenchi[/i] continuities, Sasami also has a upside down triangle birthmarked on her forehead, as a symbol of her status as Juraian royalty.   While adolescent in appearance, chronologically Sasami is over 700 years old, she was kept in a suspended animation during her sister's long search for Lord Yosho.

Sasami is an amazing cook and generally takes on the role of ""mother"" for other characters in the series, often caring for them and doing the majority of housework (especially the cooking).  Sasami is generous, sweet, caring, and always willing to put aside her needs for the needs of others.

Sasami holds a dark secret within her, in the fact that as a small child she was actually killed in an attack (by Ryoko) on the Royal Palace of Jurai.  There she was assimilated by the Goddess Tsunami (one of the three creator beings of the Universe).  Though the two are separate beings, they share the same life-force and are therefore bound integrally to each other.  This assimilation gives Sasami the ability to command the greatest ship in the Juraian Fleet, the flagship [i]Tsunami-fune[/i] which is an aspect or representation of the Goddess Tsunami herself.

In the [i]Magical Girl[/i] continuity Sasami adopts the persona of a human girl, Sasami Kawai, who is granted special powers by Tsunami, the Queen of Juraihelm, so that she may act as her representative on Earth.  With the blessings from Tsunami, Sasami is able to transform herself into Magical Girl Pretty Sammy who can use a variety of magical attacks and skills, a key factor of this power is the emotion of love.

weight_gain,"[b]Weight Gain[/b] describes images where a character is shown to have gotten fatter in some way. 

Weight gain can be explicitly depicted in a sequence of images, a comic, or an animation where a character becomes fatter, it can also be implied by dialogue, a character showing surprise, pleasure or dismay at an apparently sudden/rapid change in weight. Weight gain can also be implied, for example, by an [[overweight]] character wearing tight/ripped clothing surrounded by empty food containers or half-eaten food. Weight Gain is oftentimes depicted as the result of [[stuffing]] or [[vore]] scenarios.

Not to be confused with [[expansion]], where specific parts of a character's body usually expands through unexplained or supernatural means. However, if weight gain involves specific parts of the character's body gaining noticeably more mass alongside the rest of the body tags such as [[breast_expansion]] or [[butt_expansion]] can be applied.

sith,"Sith refers to any member of the Sith Order, a faction of Force-sensitive beings that draw upon the darker aspects of the metaphysical energy known as the Force. Though once referring to a species of red-skinned humanoids that were generally Force-sensitive, the name and culture was appropriated by a group of exiled Dark Jedi. They are primarily the antagonists of the Star Wars universe, often behind acts of tyranny, genocide and war; usually, though not always, working behind the scenes of the destruction they cause. Like the [[Jedi]], they are capable of using the Force to perform superhuman feats, which tend to be more destructive in nature and include, but are not limited to; draining life, telepathic pain, conjuring lightning, increasing strength and dexterity, or performing alchemical experiments to produce warped and tortured life forms. They also utilize [[lightsabers]] as melee weapons.

Unlike the Jedi, the Sith immerse themselves in stronger and darker emotions to fuel their connection to the Force, which generally causes them to make choices that are destructive, both to others and themselves. While numerous wars against the Jedi have forced the Sith to enact a two-member system (referred to as the Rule of Two), the Sith nevertheless employ other Force-sensitives that they do not totally train in order to have servants to quell their opposition.

[[Baile Oricorio]] is covered in red feathers with two lines of black feathers across each of its wings and tail. Its plumage resembles a frilly, flamenco dress. On the back of its head is a white ball with thin, spiraled extensions on either side that resemble earrings. Its eyelids are purple, and it has a long tail. It uses flamenco dancing.

thumb #958946

[[Pom-Pom Oricorio]] is primarily yellow. Fluffy balls of yellow feathers cover the end of its wings like pom-poms.  It uses cheerleader dancing.

thumb #958948

[[Pa'u Oricorio]] has pink feathers.  On top of its head is an arrangement of feathers resembling a headdress.  There is a larger, similar group of feathers around its waist like a skirt.  It uses hula dancing (pāʻū being a Hawaiian word for skirt, especially ones that may be used in hula).

thumb #958950

[[Sensu Oricorio]]'s feathers are mainly purple. The tips of its wings broaden into a fan shape, and it has a fan-shaped crest on top of its head.  It uses Japanese dancing (扇子 sensu being the Japanese word for a folding fan as may be used in such dances).

lizardman,"thumb #3851981 thumb #3454615  thumb #3740432 thumb #1823276 

The lizardman is a creature appearing variously in folklore, fiction, and urban legend. Modern legends include [[cryptid|cryptids]] such as the ""Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swamp"":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard_Man_of_Scape_Ore_Swamp and conspiracy theories that world leaders are ""shapeshifting reptilian aliens."":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_conspiracy_theory

The origin of the lizardman is unknown, but it is likely an amalgamation of various mythological reptilian humanoids, such as the Nagas of Hindu and Buddhist mythology, the Dragon Kings of Chinese mythology, and the Egyptian crocodile god [[Sobek]].

Lizardmen have since become a popular feature of modern fantasy and science fiction literature, games, and movies. Specific examples of this species in modern fiction include: 
* the [[Argonian|Argonians]] of [[The Elder Scrolls]] series.
* the [[lizardman_(warhammer)|Lizardmen]] of [[warhammer_(franchise)|Warhammer]], also known as the Seraphon.
* the [[lizardman_(overlord)|Lizardmen]] of the [[overlord (series)|Overlord series]].
* the [[lizardfolk_(dnd)|Lizardfolk]] of [[Dungeons and Dragons]] (D&D). 
* the [[lizard_(divinity)|Lizards]] of [[Divinity: Original Sin 2]].
* the [[lizardman_(that_time_i_got_reincarnated_as_a_slime)|Lizardmen]] of [[That time I got Reincarnated as a Slime]] that evolve into [[dragonewt|Dragonewts]].
* the [[Iksar]] from [[Everquest]].
* the [[Gorn]] from [[Star Trek]].
* the [[silurian|Silurians]] from [[Doctor Who]].

H4. Tagging guidelines
As ""lizardman"" is a generic term referring to various discrete but related fantasy creatures, akin to [[dragon]] and [[werewolf]], it should not be confused with real-life species.

A lizardman is not, strictly speaking, a [[lizard]]. It’s a vaguely reptilian creature with a humanoid or anthropomorphic appearance. As such, it may not be appropriate to tag them as lizards, and likewise most {{anthro lizard}} characters should not be tagged as lizardmen. In particular, most depictions of lizardmen across folklore and franchises lack the physical characteristics that would identify them as lizard anthros. Instead, they are typically seen with an amalgamation of characteristics borrowed from many species besides lizards, most commonly [[snake|snakes]], [[crocodilian|crocodiles]], [[dinosaur|dinosaurs]], and [[dragons]], and may even include characteristics from entirely non-reptilian species.

Lizardmen in fantasy are often associated with primitive or tribal cultures. In particular, Mayan and Aztec culture features prominently, as seen in the dress and architecture of [[Argonian|Argonians]] and [[lizardman_(warhammer)|Warhammer’s Lizardmen]].

Lizardmen may sometimes be [[humanoid]] rather than [[anthro]]. [[the_lizard_(marvel)|The Lizard]] from [[Marvel|Marvel Comics]] is sometimes depicted as a humanoid in official media, as well as the [[silurian|Silurians]] from [[Doctor Who]].

The key distinction to remember is that lizardmen are always [[anthro]], [[humanoid]], or [[semi-anthro]], and are not based on nor resemble any real-life [[lizard]] species. Rather, they are vaguely reptilian or reptile amalgam creatures that do not evoke any particular species.

h4. Tagging guidelines

[quote]
This tag cumulatively includes the following anatomy:

* [[Clitoris]] - One that belongs to a pussy. Most do.
* [[Clitoral hood]] - One that belongs to a pussy.
* Labia - Both the outer (labia majora), and inner (labia minora) folds.
* Pubic mound

Individual color tags exist for specific regions of the vulva, and should be used along with this tag.

h6. Exclusions

* Pubic hair - Use [[grey_pubes]] instead. Fur over the pussy is not [[pubes|pubic hair]]. 
* [[Pussy blush]] - Flushed areas of skin are sometimes not treated as an actual body color.

[/quote]

[section,expanded=Grey color examples]

It is not uncommon for anatomy regions of the pussy to have similar, or complementary colors. Even if all regions contain a shade of the same color, the color tag for each applicable region should still be used. Anatomy that is not visible should not get a color tag. 

h4. Pussy/Vulva ([b]grey_pussy[/b])

The color of the [[pussy]] itself, or in the case of anatomy with outer, and inner labia folds visible, this refers to the color of the outer labia folds (also known as the labia majora, or vaginal lips).

h4. Labia Minora ([[grey_inner_pussy]])

The color of the inner region of the [[pussy]], usually the inner labia folds, the region that contains the [[clitoris]]. This region is sometimes called the vestibule (entrance) into the vagina.

h4. Clitoris ([[grey_clitoris]])

The color of the erogenous nub nestled between, or above the labia, situated near the top of the [[pussy]] (or the bottom if the character is viewed from behind). Sometimes the clitoris will be hidden inside the pussy itself. 

h4. Clitoral Hood ([[grey_clitoral_hood]])

The color of the [[clitoral hood]], the skin that surrounds the [[clitoris]].

the_ferryman_(ultrakill),"The Ferryman is a Supreme Husk fought at the end of [ 5-2: WAVES OF THE STARLESS SEA ]. It can also be encountered in later waves of Cyber Grind as a special enemy.  

The Ferryman is a skeletal humanoid figure with blue bones, and a small, white robe covering his torso. He wears gold, ring-like artifacts around his limbs, and on the top of his hood is a figure that resembles a crescent moon. He also wields a large white boat oar.

Ferrymen are rare husks whose powerful bodies, trained skills and blind faith have granted them the chance of becoming the transporters of souls between the layers of Hell.

They have each been given a holy cloth by Heaven as a symbol of their devotion to God's order, which they wear over their bodies to hide the human form that they've grown to despise as a reminder of their sins in life stopping them from becoming angels.

Due to the holy power emanating from the cloth, Ferrymen's skeletal bodies have slowly been colored bright and radiant, and their skulls have enough latent energy to open the gates that otherwise stop Husks from exiting their places of torment.

Each ferry can only have one Ferryman at a time, so when a new Ferryman is formed, it will fight another to death in order to take their place and inherit their cloth. The loser's skull is taken as a trophy and used to grant the winner passage across the layers in order to transport the souls of the damned to their destinations.

Ferrymen will often use the knowledge from their past life to improve their ferries, growing past the need for oars, which are now used by the Ferrymen only as weapons.

As the influx of souls has ended with death of mankind, the Ferrymen have lost their purpose and now wander aimlessly, hoping that the angels would grant them passage into Heaven, despite Gabriel being the only one who cares about their efforts.

Throwing a coin from the Marksman Revolver at the Ferryman will allow you to skip his fight, which is how you complete the challenge of 5-2."

h4. NOTE: This game is in active development. Features will be incomplete.

[b][i]GROVE[/i][/b] is a (currently) free gay-focused NSFW RPG following the journey of an adventurer as he attempts to venture into the far north of an unexplored land. You play as [[grove_(regalbuster)|Grove]], a skilled [[dragon]] explorer and [[cartographer]] assisting in the main island colonization efforts known as the ""central expanse.""

As parties disperse, individuals begin to disappear further towards the cusp of the north. Soon, rumors of [color=pink]curses[/color] and monstrous entities encroaching from the northern expanse begin to spread among your ranks. As you near the end of your allocated survey areas, you are given a strange contraption with a marked map, the only guide to its function.

Your interest piqued, you set off and begin your journey into the northern expanse.

douglas_(iceleung),"Some useful info on my fluffy scaley boy:

[b]Name:[/b] Douglas ""Doug"" Frostwind
[b]Species:[/b] Eastern Dragon
[b]Age:[/b] 26
[b]Height:[/b] 4'3"", tail is apprx. 3' long and can be magically extended
[b]Occupation:[/b] Crafter of magical focuses and spell books
[b]Likes:[/b] Sushi, ramen, comedy/superhero/sci-fi movies, working with his hands, having his fur brushed, and hot drinks on cold days
[b]Dislikes:[/b] Green veggies, hot weather, low-quality hairbrushes, and disruptions in his daily schedule
[b]Sexuality:[/b] Bisexual, leaning male
[b]Kinks:[/b] Small dom/big sub, bondage, tickling, feet/paws, spanking, humiliation, gags, blindfolds, and pet play (master role)

A few quick facts about Doug:
* Being an ice dragon, his scales are naturally cool to the touch. A bit ironically, his favorite drink is hot cocoa.
* His tail is completely prehensile, able to be controlled by him at will. It is also quite strong, able to support his entire body and lift it off the ground to make him taller, a skill which has come in handy at many points in his life due to his short height. He can also use it to wrap up folks he feels may need a lesson or two about picking on the small.~
* He wears prescription glasses; without them his vision is quite bad, and he can only see clearly a few feet in front of him. Still, he can make people and places out fairly well even if he has to squint to do so.
* His favorite clothing items are hoodies and cargo shorts; the former for their comfort, and the latter for their extra storage space.
* He has a boyfriend, a lion by the name of Mars. He loves to steal the bigger fur's sweatshirts for himself sometimes. Mars is also the only person around allowed to call Douglas ""Dougie"".
* His job leaves him well off financially, but a good amount of that money goes into... Personal items (Read; bondage gear and other adult toys) and he prefers to keep his looks and home decor casual.
* Being a mage, Douglas has access to many forms of magic, but his strongest suit is undoubtedly ice magic thanks to his frost dragon heritage. He can cast magic without the need of a focus, but use of a wand he made for himself makes it that much more powerful and allows him to expand the length of his tail if he desires.
* If there's anything else you wanna know, feel free to ask!

Jamila is an anthropomorphic jackal with black fur, golden tattoos that goes over her right side torso like a strap bag with The Eyes of Horus sideways next to her belly button, wears golden arm rings, golden leg straps, short tail and doesn't wear any clothes. 

Jamila is a sexually attractive Anubis in Egypt who was abused by her father Jackal when she was younger. When she was gifted with goddess powers from Remana (the demoness goat), she began to misuse it. She ended up commiting parricide and took over her father's throne. Jamila never felt such power and proceed to use it for evil deeds. She is thousands of years old, became a dictator and a ruthless goddess who seeks domination and watch the world burn. She has a son named Abdullah (his father was a slave that Jamila ended killing after mating), which she takes advantage of, even forcefully perform incest ever since he was young for her sick pleasures (Abdullah now 21). Arch enemy towards Tevelski, however Jamila's arch nemesis would have to be ""La Llorona"":https://e621.net/wiki_pages/show_or_new?title=la_llorona_%28gt_evolution%29 who is suprisenly a strong enemy to take on. La Llorona isn't exactly a killable person who is already dead. 
Jamila killed every gods and goddesses in Egypt. Sobek, Sekhmet, Hathor and obtained all of their powers. Any that she kills, she harness the previous wielder and builds up power. Jamila seeks the angelic stone to become even more powerful than a god. However, she stumbles Makaria who was responsible turning Sabrina into ""Hellena"":https://e621.net/wiki_pages/47683. Makaria is a corrupted goddess who wants to eliminate mortals by transforming them into celestial beings. Guarding the angelic stone, Makaria doesn't allow Jamila to obtain such source as she knows she'll be an unstoppable goddess. Jamila isn't the only PREY character that seeks for the Angelic Stone. Her rival Zalina, a clouded leopard from Brunei also wants it for her jewelry collection. She doesn't really care about the power it has. Zalina is already powerful. She just likes how it looks and is determine to get it

ryan_(river_city_ransom),"[b]Ryan[/b] is one of two playable characters appearing in the first [i][[River City Ransom]][/i] game, and following sequel [i]River City Ransom: Underground[/i]. In the broader [[Kunio-kun]] series, this character goes by the name [[Riki Samejima]].

The other playable character is [[alex_(river_city_ransom)|Alex]] (known as [[Kunio]] in the broader series). The two characters look nearly identical in the original game sprites. For references and cosplays, Alex wears a white t-shirt, and blue pants, and Ryan wears a blue t-shirt, and white pants. Appearances in box art, revamped sprites in the sequel, and port releases reveal additional design characteristics, and outfit changes from the original game. However the trend of Alex having a white theme (white shirt), and Ryan having a blue or dark theme (blue shirt, or blue hair) remains a consistent means of distinguishing the characters.

"
dominant,"Dominance is a set of behaviors, customs and rituals involving the giving by one individual to another individual of control over them in an erotic episode or as a lifestyle.

Physical contact is not a necessity, and it can even be conducted anonymously over the telephone, email or other messaging system. In other cases, it can be intensely physical, sometimes traversing into sadomasochism. In D/s, both parties take pleasure or erotic enjoyment from either dominating or being dominated. Those who take the superior position are called dominants, doms (male) or dommes (female), while those who take the subordinate position are called submissives or subs (male or female). A switch is an individual who plays in either role. Two switches together may negotiate and exchange roles several times in a session. ""Dominatrix"" is a term usually reserved for a female professional dominant who dominates others for pay.

A general test for domination/submission is whether there is an imbalance of power, whether it be real (held at spear point) or permitted (holding a leash).


Tag also applies if the theme of domination is present in the image.

lasgun,"The Lasgun is an energy based weapon, and is the most common and widely used type of laser weapon in the Imperium. It is standard issue for all Imperial Guard infantry and most lower-ranked officers.
Lasguns are reliable, easy to maintain and produce, and are readily available on most Imperial worlds. They have longer range and higher ammunition capacity than a Laspistol (the laspistol power packs having roughly 80 shots before depletion, compared to roughly 150 shots for a lasgun), but are nowhere near as powerful as a Lascannon. They also lack the rapid-fire quality of the Multi-laser or the Hellgun.
The lasgun uses the same basic technology and operates along the same lines as other laser weapons, emitting a beam of focused light. The high amount of energy in the beam causes the immediate surface area of a target to be vaporized in a small explosion.  It is a relatively unimpressive weapon when compared to other weapons in the Imperium, but is still capable of cleanly severing limbs or piercing the power armour of a Space Marine (but only through a vulnerable spot in the armour). Most designs have iron sights mounted along the top of the weapon. It is powered by a small, rechargeable power pack located beneath the weapon, in front of the trigger guard.

The [b]Nintendo Game Boy[/b] (often spelled as Gameboy and abbreviated as GB), is [[Nintendo]]'s second handheld system after the [[Game and Watch]]. Following the success of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], Nintendo decided to make a handheld gaming system to capitalize on the success. Using tech similar to the NES, Nintendo released the Game Boy in 1989 in Japan and the United States, Europe in 1990, and Brazil in 1994. The console was praised for having a quality library of games, including Super Mario Land 1 and 2, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, [[Pokemon]] Red and Blue, and Tetris. The console's competitors were the [[Atari Lynx]], and the [[Game Gear]]. The system sold over 119 million units worldwide, making it the third best selling console of all time, behind the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation 2]]. The system was discontinued in 2003, with the last releases being [i]Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Kanji no Tatsujin and Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Keisan no Tatsujin[/i], released in Japan on March 30, 2001, and the last release in America being Pokemon Yellow. The successor would be the [[Game Boy Color]].

[section,expanded=Model differences]

It is easy to confuse this model with the Game Boy Color. In most cases it should be possible to tell which model it is.

h5. Highly distinguishable features

These features should be given high priority when it comes to console identification, especially when presented with conflicting console designs.

* Face buttons on the Game Boy are positioned at a slant. All models following featured horizontally aligned face buttons.
* The cartridge port on the back is embedded into the original Game Boy. It extends outwards on the Game Boy Color and other models.
* The bottom right of the console is where the speaker is. It has a distinctive curved edge, and slanted grooves over the speaker. The curves are uniform and the grooves were replaced with holes on the Game Boy Color.

h5. Less distinguishable features

* The logo is usually distinctive when present. The logo appears below the screen in both models. The original Game Boy logo is left aligned, and the Game Boy Color logo is center aligned.
* Screen may have a greenish tinting. This should not be present on the Game Boy Color and later models.
* The power switch is on top of the original Game Boy, and on the right side on the Game Boy Color. The power switch replaces a volume slider and an [[game link cable]] extension port.
* There are grooves on the right side on both the original Game Boy and the Game Boy Color. However the original Game Boy has the grooves underneath the volume slider, and extension port, and the grooves are above the power switch on the Game Boy Color. These grooves may not be present on other Game Boy models such as the Game Boy Pocket.
* It is far more common for the Game Boy Color to be drawn in bright colors such as yellow, while the original Game Boy taking on more muted grey tones. This may not always be true, so pay attention to the details.

The Game Boy Pocket is distinctive in that it is smaller than the original Game Boy, but still resembling the Game Boy construction. While its shape is consistent with the original model, its buttons are aligned horizontally like the Game Boy Color.

Mashiro is the female protagonist of the story. She is the resident of room 202. She is a world famous artist who transferred into Suiko as a second-year to learn how to draw manga. Although her artworks are widely admired by the world in spite of her young age, she knows nothing other than drawing, and has an extreme lack of common sense and living ability. Due to this, Sorata is forced to handle Mashiro's living chores, to the point that he even has to pick out underwear for her, or she will go out without them.

She has very bad grades, since she cannot pay attention to the class, but she can still pass the make-up exams by remembering all of the answers with her art talent.

[spoiler]In the third volume, Mashiro starts to grow feelings for Sorata, and she even claims that she cannot live without him.

Manufactured by Tupolev, the Tu-22 entered service with the Soviet military in the 1960s. The last examples were retired during the early 2000s. Produced in comparatively small numbers, the aircraft was a disappointment, lacking the intercontinental range that had been expected. Later in their service life, Tu-22s were used as launch platforms for the Soviet Kh-22 standoff missile, and as reconnaissance aircraft. Tu-22s were sold to other nations, including Libya and Iraq. The Tu-22 was one of the few Soviet bombers to see combat; Libyan Tu-22s were used against Tanzania and Chad, and Iraqi Tu-22s were used during the Iran–Iraq War."

* A butt shot can range from just an image of the character's buttocks alone, to showing their thighs and some of their upper body
* A butt shot should not show the character's entire lower body or entire upper body
** Depending on pose and angle, a character's upper back or shoulders may be seen
* A butt shot should not depict the character's head in the same shot as their butt
** The character's face may be shown in a [[cutaway]] panel, or a second shot showing a different angle 
** If the character's head is visible in the same shot, the post should be probably tagged as [[butt focus]] instead

thumb #2806689 thumb #3021947

Butt focus depicts most, or all, of a character, in a way that focuses on their butt through pose, angles or lighting.
If most of the character is visible, especially their head, the image is butt focus, not butt shot.

h6. [[Butt Pose]]

thumb #1458017 thumb #2966939

""Butt pose"" describes a character viewed from behind, with their upper body turned back towards the viewer.

Rear view simply describes a character viewed from behind, as opposed to a [[front view]]. While this tag doesn't imply any focus or pose by itself, butt shot, butt pose, and butt focus images all almost inherently involve a rear view, but there are some exceptions.

* A post containing a fan character should always include the franchise they are based off of.
* A character [[cosplay|cosplaying]] as a character from a media property (and is not intended to be a character in that property's universe), should not be tagged as `fan_character`.

Fan characters can range in how ""close"" to the source material they are — they may be characters that are very faithful to the visual style of the media, they may be explicitly shown inhabiting the setting of the world they are based off of, possibly drawn interacting with canonical characters, and/or engaging in activities that are part of that media (e.g. a [i]Pokémon[/i] fan character who engages in battles similar to that of the [i]Pokémon[/i] franchise). 

In other cases, fan characters may have designs or be drawn in styles that diverge from the source material (this is especially the case with fan characters who are [[anthrofied]] versions of canonically [[feral]] species), and of be shown in settings entirely unrelated to the canon material while still clearly appearing to be a fan character. 

Fan characters may be fandom interpretations of canonical characters (fan canon, or ""fanon"" characters), or fan characters that have taken on a life beyond their initial creator and become a popular subject of fan art and media (this is especially common within the [i]My Little Pony[/i] fandom).

adolf_hitler,"[b]Adolf Hitler[/b] (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an [[Austrian]]-born [[German]] politician and the leader of the [[Nazi|Nazi Party]]. He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of [[tag group:nazi germany|Nazi Germany]] (known as the Leader, or ""Führer"") from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of the fascist ideological movement, spearheading the events of [[world_war_2|World War II]] in Europe and the ""Holocaust"":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust. During the final days of the war, he and his wife Eva Braun committed suicide, the former shooting himself and the latter using a cyanide pill. Suffice to say, he was not a pleasant man. 

The film [i]Der Untergang[/i] (also known as [i]The Downfall[/i] or just [i]Downfall[/i]) is his most famous portrayal to date. He was portrayed by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. That production has spawned the famous series of Hitler rant [[parody]] videos.

sparkles,"thumb #1411406 thumb #698587 thumb #692005

This tag is used when an element of the post has a glittery effect, like the kind you would see on a [[glistening]] object or surface with light refracting properties. A similar effect to sparkling is [[glare_(lighting)|glare]], a phenomenon in which many light photons are emitted or reflected off a surface causing a bright blinding light.

Sparkles are commonly used for effect, such as when an artist wants to draw attention to some aspect of the scene. This does not necessarily mean that object is [[glistening]], and most of the time the sparkles are merely around the object, and not touching it.

Sparkles are used as a substitute for [[star|stars]], but they should not be confused for stars. Sparkles should be considered as stars if used in a star context. The only exception to this is [[star eyes]] / [[star pupils]], which is used for anything vaguely star-shaped.

sasha_(animal_crossing),"Sasha (jp: ミッチェル Mitchell) is a lazy rabbit villager introduced in the New Horizons 2.0 update. He is the first and currently the only male villager to have the fashion hobby.

Sasha is a light seafoam green rabbit. His muzzle, paws, and eartips are white with a gradient. His nose and the insides of his ears are a light orange color. He also has a tuft of blond bangs across his forehead, and his tail is a matching shade of yellow. He has large, reflective eyes with small eyelashes; his eyes typically have large dark pupils with two white reflections in each and no visible irises, but he gains lavender irises when surprised. His default outfit is the blue Letter Jacket.
As a lazy villager, Sasha will be friendly and easy to get along with due to his laid back lifestyle. Like all lazy villagers, he has a love of food and relaxing. He will enjoy partaking in the usual hobbies, usually for relaxing reasons or for food, like when fishing. Sasha will get along well with other villagers, but may offend or confuse jock villagers, who have a lifestyle of exercise and fitness, which conflicts with the lazy lifestyle of relaxing and food. He will get along with other lazy villagers with whom he will talk about food, comics, or superheroes. He will also get along well with normal, peppy, smug and sisterly villagers, and occasionally cranky villagers, but may from time to time annoy snooty villagers, who disagree with the lazy lifestyle."

scp-2845,"thumb #1714910
[b]SCP-2845[/b], aka The Deer, is a Threat Level-Black, Keter Class Object.  

SCP-2845 is a quadruped entity, measuring 2.9 meters in height at the shoulder and weighing 815 kilograms. A sinuous neck, generally held in an upright position, extends a further .5 m, terminating in a head with humanoid facial features. SCP-2845 possesses antlers, measuring 4.8 meters across: Antlers are white with black marbling in coloration, and have not been observed to shed. SCP-2845 is covered in hair with an average length of 10 cm, with the exception of the face, which is hairless. SCP-2845’s coloration is primarily a pastel green, with a stripe of cream on the underside of the neck and belly.

A ring of ice particles is suspended 15 cm behind SCP-2845’s skull, measuring 1.7 m in diameter, with a ring thickness of 35 cm. This ring is interrupted at regular intervals by seven spheres consisting of metallic hydrogen and metallic helium, each measuring 15 cm in diameter. The ring and spheres rotate clockwise at a speed of 1.6 rpm. The force maintaining the movement of the ring, the physical state of the spheres, and the means by which SCP-2845 is capable of supporting its head under the weight of its antlers are unknown.

SCP-2845 is capable of instantaneous transmutation and reconstruction of matter. No matter is created or destroyed during this process. This property is manifested at will, with an observed range extending to targets within eyesight: maximum range of this ability is unknown. Transmuted matter will remain stable despite the lack of other factors: for example, metallic hydrogen and helium are common results, which will remain in either solid or liquid form despite the surrounding temperature. Altered atmosphere will not mix with unaltered regions, maintaining chemical consistency. The most common transmutation results are the solid or liquid forms of hydrogen, and helium, the conversion of atmosphere into a hydrogen/helium/ammonia mix, and the transmutation of plant life into metalloid-based organisms. SCP-2845 will typically surround itself with a transmuted area with a radius of approximately five meters at all times. SCP-2845 has proven itself completely resistant to physical damage.

The most common forms of offensive transmutation used by SCP-2845 are a column measuring five to seven meters in diameter and sixty to eighty meters in height, or a horizontal cone measuring between one hundred and one hundred and fifty meters in length and ten to thirty meters in width at the furthest end. However, SCP-2845 has been observed to attack single targets at distances of up to 10 kilometers. Early observation of SCP-2845 during recovery indicated that it will generally ignore non-combatants, focusing on retaliation against attackers. However, SCP-2845 was not seen to make any attempts to spare non-combatants within the area of effect of its transmutations, and later recovery accounts indicate pre-emptive attacks against both military and civilian targets.

SCP-2845-1 designates human beings that have been modified by SCP-2845. Instances of SCP-2845-1 are hexagonal columns measuring 2.4 meters in height, with rubbery yellow-green skin. SCP-2845-1 instances do not have any outward sense organs, and autopsy has shown that internal organs are likewise absent, save the brain, which now takes up the entirety of the column and contains the reconstituted mass of the other organs and some additional outside materials. It is unknown how SCP-2845-1 instances derive nutrients, or if any nutrition is required.

SCP-2845 splintered off of a comet and crash landed on earth on December 21st, 2011 (One Year before The End of the World according to the Mayan Calendar).  In order to keep the Deer God contained at a special shrine where a series of 6 elaborate 39 minute rituals must be performed within intervals of 10 hours, to a total of 63 Hours and 54 Minutes.  Failure to complete the ritual cycle correctly may result the Deer God becoming displeased and suddenly going on an unrollable rampage.

SCP-2845 is based on the the Titan King Saturn from Roman mythology.  Its description is also a pun.  It is basically a literal ""Deer/Dear God"" and due the incredibly long nature of its containment procedure and the fact that it is a Teal Deer, it is also a [[TL;DR]]."

As with [[lamia]], a creature with an [[ophidian]] upper body would not be a marilith, but simply a multi-arm [[naga]].

Note that the [i][[Final Fantasy I]][/i] character ""[[marilith (final fantasy i)|Marilith]]"" is considered a specific marilith character, and that tag should not be merged into this one. (And, despite her armament, should not imply the [i][[dungeons_and_dragons]][/i] tag.)

tarasque,"From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarasque :

The {{Tarasque}} is a fearsome legendary {{dragon}}-like mythological hybrid from Provence, in southern France, tamed in a story about Saint Martha.

The legend of the Tarasque is reported in several sources, but especially in the story of St. Martha in the Golden Legend.[2] The creature inhabited the area of Nerluc in Provence, France, and devastated the landscape far and wide. The Tarasque was a sort of dragon with a lion's head, six short legs like a bear's, an ox-like body covered with a turtle shell, and a scaly tail that ended in a scorpion's sting. Other legends report it as living on the modern site of the Chateau Tarascon; i.e. on a rock in the midst of the Rhone. According to the Golden Legend ""There was, at that time, on the banks of the Rhone, in a marsh between Arles and Avignon, a {{dragon}}, half animal, half {{fish}}, thicker than an {{ox}}, longer than an {{horse}}, with {{teeth}} like {{sword}}s and big as {{horns}}, he hid in the {{river}} where he took the life of all passers-by and submerged vessels."" ""Sainte Marthe"". L'Abbaye Sainte Benoit. Retrieved 28 Jan 2013.

The {{Tarasque}} was said to have come from Galatia which was the home of the legendary Onachus, a {{scaly}}, {{bison}}-like {{beast}} which burned everything it touched (this creature is similar to the Bonnacon). The {{Tarasque}} was the offspring of the Onachus and the {{Leviathan}} of biblical account; disputably a giant {{sea_serpent}}.

The {{king}} of Nerluc had attacked the {{Tarasque}} with {{knight}}s and {{catapult}}s to no avail. But Saint Martha found the {{beast}} and {{charm}}ed it with hymns and {{pray}}ers, and led back the {{tamed}} Tarasque to the city. The people, {{terrified}} by the {{monster}}, attacked it when it drew nigh. The {{monster}} offered no resistance and died there. Martha then preached to the people and converted many of them to Christianity. Sorry for what they had done to the {{tamed}} {{monster}}, the newly Christianized townspeople changed the town's name to Tarascon.

The story of the Tarasque is also very similar to the story of {{Beauty_and_the_Beast}} and {{King_Kong}}. The {{monster}} is {{charmed}} and {{weakened}} by a {{woman}} and then {{killed}} when brought back to civilization. A similar idea is found in the myths of Enkidu and the {{unicorn}}: both are calmed by sending them a {{woman}}. The description and legend of this creature is curiously similar to other {{dragons}} of French folklore such as {{Gargouille}} and Peluda."

chaos_sorcerer,"Chaos Sorcerers are powerful spellcasters who use the raw Winds of Magic to cast spells and unleash Chaos Sorcery.

Those Champions of Chaos who seek mastery over the magical arts are known as Chaos Sorcerers, and they are madmen and malcontents all. They are amongst the most awful and depraved of all servants of the Ruinous Powers, for they long ago sold their souls in exchange for the heady elixir of pure power. Where many of the Known World's wizards, such as those taught by the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, glean their arcane skill from long years of painstaking research, a Chaos Sorcerer's understanding of the Winds of Magic is often instant and innate. Without the patience and wisdom that such study brings, an inexorable descent into deformity, mutation and madness is nigh on inevitable.

Chaos Sorcerers are masters of Dark Magic, and there is little beyond their might. They can transport themselves over vast distances, call upon the fires of Tzeentch, slaughter men by the scores, and more. But such magic comes at a terrible price. As they tap the energies of Chaos, their sanity withers whilst their bodies twist and mutate with the invoked energies.

Chaos Sorcerers may be found amongst the savage tribes of the Men of the North, serving as oracles and counsellors, but many also come from the civilised lands of the Empire and beyond. These individuals, finding the limitations on magic within the Imperial Colleges of Magic too restrictive, and lured by the power to be held by dabbling in daemonology, drift north to bring themselves closer to the source of their magic in the Chaos Wastes, learning through trial and error.

What separates Chaos Sorcerers from other spellcasters, namely the Magisters of the Empire, witches, and warlocks, is that these individuals derive their power directly from the Chaos Gods. Thus, only mortal servants of Nurgle, Slaanesh, and Tzeentch may become Chaos Sorcerers. There are no sorcerers of Khorne, for the mortal servants of the Blood God abhor the use of magic as the weapon of cowards, like their divine patron.

According to Magister Patriarch Verspasian Kant, Chaos Sorcerers benefit from the guidance of their chosen Chaos deity, similar to a practictioner of Divine Magic, channeling and focusing the unbridled potentiality of the Aethyr through their Dark God rather than drawing upon the Winds of Magic directly. As such, the magic of a Chaos Sorcerer bears unique traits that are otherwise non-existent or unachievable using more usual methods of spellcasting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sorcerer or Chaos Sorcerer is the most powerful type of psyker found among the Chaos Space Marines and the other mortal forces of Chaos.

Sorcerers serve the same role as Librarians do for Loyalist Space Marine Chapters and Sanctioned Psykers do for the Astra Militarum, though many powerful sorcerers can also be considered psychically-gifted Champions of Chaos and Sorcerer Lords.

Instead of the subtle psychic manipulation and divination used by the Farseers of the Aeldari or the strength-boosting powers of the Space Marine Librarians, the sorcerers of Chaos wield death, destruction, and mutation, the mightiest powers of the Warp.

Sorcerers of Chaos shape destiny itself with arcane rituals and unspeakable pacts forged with the malefic entities -- the Daemons -- of the Empyrean. In truth, ""sorcery"" itself differs from other forms of psychic ability because it requires interacting and cutting deals for knowledge and/or power with the entities of the Warp in the pursuit of one's own selfish gain.

Through the knowledge gained by such pacts, sorcerers channel the soul-blasting energies of the Warp into potent hexes and blasts of wyrdflame, and they mould the fabric of the material universe with little more than a hate-filled curse.

Because of their constant exposure to the power of Chaos, sorcerers are inevitably haunted by the prospect of eventually succumbing to crippling mutation or insanity. Though they believe they are above mortal concerns, the truth is that they, too, are only pawns, raised up and then expended by the Dark Gods for their own amusement.

The line between wielding psychic power and true ""sorcery"" is a fine one indeed. The Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes may seek to deny it, but every time a Space Marine Librarian calls upon his mental might he risks tainting his soul.

In the heat of battle, even the most capable psyker may overreach his abilities, and instead of recoiling in horror from the resultant carnage, he may feel a forbidden thrill. Such emotions are the first step on a path to limitless evil.

From that moment on, the psyker may endure honeyed whispers in his dreams and visions of immortality. Those who succumb to such temptations and make deals for power with the Daemonic denizens of the Immaterium become true sorcerers, able to channel the malefic power of the Warp to its fullest extent, unconstrained by morality or consequences.

Sorcerers are forever driven to expand their influence and knowledge. They see themselves as having ascended; no longer hindered by blind loyalty to the Corpse-God of the Imperium, they become even more callous and inhuman than those who follow them.

Some are cold-hearted strategists who vent their hatred upon as much of the universe as possible; Ygethmor the Deceiver once orchestrated a doomsday cult that resulted in the depopulation of every inhabited world in the Corriallis System.

Others act as advisors for Chaos Lords, subtly redirecting them to their own ends under the illusion of servitude. A rare few roam the hidden paths of the universe, unlocking the secrets of the ancients to better plunge the galaxy into the embrace of Chaos.

Regardless of their goals, all sorcerers revel in the anarchy of the Long War. It takes only a flicker of resistance to spur them into unleashing the destructive energies of the Immaterium. Their bitterness manifests upon the battlefield as a palpable force; red-hot skulls hammer down from the skies, disease chokes the souls of those nearby, and men are turned into monsters in their wake.

The martial prowess common to all Chaos Space Marines is magnified greatly when combined with the weapons of the sorcerer, baleful artefacts saturated with the energies of Chaos that can rip the soul from the body of their victim.

The Thousand Sons Legion gave rise to the first Space Marine sorcerers during the early days of the Great Crusade. Even before the Horus Heresy, the XVth Legion of Magnus the Red had a thirst for knowledge of the Warp that proved impossible to slake, and ultimately proved their undoing.

In his arrogance and ignorance, Magnus ignored the warnings of his father the Emperor and could not stop himself from dealing with the denizens of the Warp in the search for ever more knowledge about how to enhance and extend his psychic abilities and those of his Astartes.

Without even realising it, he struck a pact with the Chaos God Tzeentch that ultimately resulted in the damnation of himself and his Legion. Most of the Thousand Sons' number were ultimately reduced to unliving automatons by the Rubric of Ahriman, though the most psychically powerful among them were able to resist the unforeseen consequences of that grand ritual.

Many of these ancient sorcerers have now forged pacts with Abaddon the Despoiler, joining the Warmaster of Chaos in his quest to overthrow the Imperium of Man and adding the strength of their Rubricae bodyguards to that of the Black Legion.

Bio:  Don is downright obsessive about his position as the station’s security director.  He sees danger lurking around every corner, and though he has a small staff to help him, he often over-works himself trying to identify and neutralize potential threats.  It’s not unusual for him to work for days without rest, which only makes him more demanding and on-edge.  To put it nicely, he’s not the most popular person on the station.  Because he overreacts to things so spectacularly, it’s become somewhat of a sport among the station’s troublemakers to try to set him off.  He has also rung up an impressive number of nicknames (all courtesy of Tattle), the current favorites being S.D., Security Don, Shevi, Donni-boy, and “the wettest of blankets.”  Don does not approve of any of these.

telechat,"The series, aimed at children, parodies the television news program for adults with the concept of ""object television"". Sprinkled with reports and interviews dedicated to the objects, the Téléchat newspaper invariably begins with the sequence of the ""celebrated object"" of the day, the presenters wishing a ""happy birthday"" to the object in question.

The diary is featured by two anthropomorphic animal puppets: a cat named Groucha (who has one arm in a cast) and an ostrich named Lola. Other characters regularly intervene such as Mic-Mac, Groucha's microphone, but also other objects present on the set. In addition, Gluons (microscopic beings that live in various objects), are interviewed and talk about their lives in the sequence ""Objects in the air.""

During the newspaper advertising pages are spread, the opportunity to see the Monkey Pub-Pub present “Null” products, but always in a catastrophic way. It also presents the adventures of the vigilante Léguman, a man disguised with a pumpkin head who fights against the bad guys.

After the end credits, a sequence shows Groucha and Lola arguing in an unprofessional context after work, often in the cafe (the Milk Bar), as if to remind people that the characters' experiences are not limited to your profession.

In the second season, Groucha is replaced by another presenter, the GTI rabbit (for ""Grégoire de la Tour d'Ivoire""). GTI is related to a person in charge of the channel and wants to rejuvenate the antenna. This character symbolizes the economic pressures exerted on journalists; As a result of his flagrant professional misconduct, he was fired, in particular for having ""destroyed the advertisement"".

The tone of the program, by way of humor, is quite critical and speaks of television, advertising, audience races or ""airdrops""."

seel,"thumb #185224 thumb #520633

Source: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Seel_(Pok%C3%A9mon)

Seel (Japanese: パウワウ Pawou) is a Water-type Pokémon. 

It evolves into Dewgong starting at level 34. 

Seel is a pinniped Pokémon with a thick hide covered in bluish white fur. It has a pale tan maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw. It has circular eyes and a black nose that is capable of closing while Seel swims. There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes. It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail. When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout. 

Seel lives on icebergs in frigid ocean waters. Its warm fur and thick hide allow it to swim in waters as cold as -40°F. It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops. Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours. While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land.

lightsaber,"The [b]lightsaber[/b], sometimes referred to as a laser sword, is a weapon primarily used by Force-sensitive individuals in the [i][[Star Wars]][/i] universe. Lightsabers consisted of a plasma blade, powered by a focusing crystal and usually emitted from a metallic hilt (thought other materials are sometimes used). Use in the weapon required considerable skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with [[the Force]]. The lightsaber is generally associated with the [[Jedi]] and [[Sith]] factions, with many in the galaxy believing only Jedi used lightsabers at all (though there have been demonstrations of non-sensitives utilizing lightsaber's as well; usually, but not always, with considerably less skill).

Lightsaber blades can be of nearly any color, though blue and green blades are typical of the Jedi faction, while red is commonly associated with the Sith. Some Jedi base the color of their blade on their chosen path, with Guardians utilizing blue blades; Consulars wielding green blades; and the lesser-known and often unseen Sentinels using yellow-hued blades. Rarely seen in the [i]Star Wars[/i] universe are violet-hued lightsaber blades (like the one wielded by Jedi Master Mace Windu); rarer still are black-colored lightsaber blades, which are sometimes referred to as darksabers."

A character from the mixed-media series [i]Zero no Tsukaima[/i].

Tiffa is a half-elf born from the relationship of the Archduke of Albion and his elven mistress.  Her magical abilites come from a ring left to her by her late mother, after using her magic to revive Saito the ring is consumed.  Tiffa is quite, soft spoken and well endowed (saito described her once as ""the Big-breasted elf who saved his life"").  Her skin is pale, her ears are pointed (revealing her elven heritage which she often conceals beneath hoods or scarves) and her hair is a beautiful honey-gold color.

Later in the series Tiffa's royalty is recognized by Henrietta of the Kingdom of Albion, allowing her to officially join the Tristain Academy of Magic with Louise and Saito (for whom she has developed a budding love).  At first Tiffa is ostracized because of her elven heritage, but with Saito's help she overcomes the prejudice with her warm personality, kindness, and beauty.

It is revealed eventually that Tiffa is a Void Mage as well, like Louise and her spell to summon a familiar in fact summons Saito Hiraga as well, leading to him having two masters and quite a bit of tension between the three.

daww,"thumb #2666352 thumb #4491708 thumb #2212754 thumb #2429878 thumb #4327913 thumb #2977832

A tag for posts that are intended to be cute, endearing, and/or evoke a feeling of intimacy, wholesomeness, or tenderness — imagery that may make the viewer say [i]""d'aww""[/i].

Think a cute kid character hugging a plush, a couple spending time with each other, a happy wedding, puppies and kittens playing, parents doing fun activities with their kids, friends sharing a hug or a character receiving a head rub or head pat. ""Daww"" also frequently involves stereotypically cute characters, with big, glossy, expressive eyes, and [[chibi|chibi-fied]] anatomy (in some cases, adult characters may appear or explicitly be [[aged down]] to cuter, child versions of themselves).

[section,expanded=General guidelines]

* Most images that fall under `daww` will be [[rating:s|rated safe]], but exceptions do exist. It is highly recommended that this tag not be used for lewd scenes and contexts. This may include, but is not limited to:

- [[pinup|Pinups]]
- [[Ahegao]] or similar lewd expressions.
- [[Suggestive]] content unless it is very innocent in nature.
- [[Presenting]] or other sexual invitations.

Situations involving [[casual nudity]], [[casual exposure]], the depiction of an [[x anus]] or [[genitals]] in a non-sexualized manner, the depiction of [[blood]] do not outright disqualify an image from being tagged as daww. It matters more that the scene doesn't contain an apparent sexual theme that would distract from an otherwise innocent context.

thumb #121758 thumb #3339688 thumb #4149486 thumb #649695

Try to tag for situations where the character is doing something that enhances the emotional quality of the scene itself. It can involve just a pose, or a particular expression, but consider leaving more generic scenarios out of the tag.

[b]Super Sonic[/b] (スーパーソニック Sūpā Sonikku) is a recurring transformation that appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is the Super State of Sonic the Hedgehog, achieved by harnessing the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds. Since its debut, this form has been Sonic's most commonly used transformation.

When transformed into Super Sonic, Sonic's blue fur becomes golden yellow in color, his peach skin gains a slightly golden hue, and the quills on his head become upturned. Additionally, his green eyes become ruby red and his facial expression becomes more aggressive, with his eyes gaining sharpened corners. He also possesses a golden aura that varies in size and can be anything from smooth to flame-like in shape. His aura also sometimes displays either faint sparkles or electrical sparks.

As Super Sonic, Sonic can fly at speeds greatly surpassing his normal running pace. His body also becomes completely impervious to physical damage, allowing him to plow through numerous enemies with relative ease. He can also use various chaos powers, most notably Chaos Control to manipulate time and space; He can use this to teleport, slow/freeze time, or travel through time.

Super Sonic's main weakness is that he cannot transform unless he has at least 50 rings and all 7 chaos emeralds. For every second he remains Super Sonic, he looses one ring. If he looses all his rings or any emeralds, he will change back and lose a life.

Super Sonic rather notoriously resembles the Super Saiyan transformation from [[Dragon Ball Z]]. Officially Super Sonic was conceived before Super Saiyan, but was designed after it and Akira Toriyama (The Creator of Dragon Ball Z) never inquired about this to [[SEGA]]."

hot_air_balloon,"thumb #656575

A [b]hot air balloon[/b] is lighter than air [[aircraft]] consisting of a bag called the envelope that is capable of containing heated air. Suspended beneath is a [[gondola]] or wicker [[basket]] (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and (usually) a source of heat, in most cases an open flame. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the relatively cold air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere.

If the balloon has an elongated shape, or the craft seems to have a method of propulsion such as rudders or engines, use [[airship]] instead.

""Elizaveta Boyarskaya"":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizaveta_Boyarskaya (Russian) and ""Ruby Rose"":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Rose (English dub) as Bianca.
Bianca went through the most re-drawings, sketches and 3D models out of all the film's characters. The designers intended to achieve a ""pretty"" and ""decisive"" style for her. The character was originally planned to have light skin, but the final result for her was a wolf with darker blue fur given the light color ""looked bad"" with Grey. As Boyarskaya explained, considering that Bianca was ""so beautiful,"" she had to speak her lines at a much higher pitch than she was comfortable with, which caused her to ""almost [break her] voice."""

[b]Surge the Tenrec[/b] is a character that appears in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW)]] comic series. She is an anthropomorphic tenrec who was modified into a villainous cyborg by [[Doctor Starline]] with no memories of her past, and the companion of [[Kitsunami the Fennec]]. Initially made for the intended purpose of destroying Sonic the Hedgehog and replacing him as the hero of the world, she would begin seeking revenge on everyone she blames for her past life being taken away from her after discovering the truth of her origin.

Having been modified by Dr. Starline with cybernetic enhancements, Surge possesses an array of powers. She has the ability to generate electricity of varying intensity and project it as small lightning bolts or sparks, as well as the ability to move at super speeds fast enough to keep up with Sonic."

unicorn,"thumb #48550 thumb #1038368 thumb #1138609

A [b]unicorn[/b] is a mythological [[equine]] with a single, usually spiraled [[horn]] growing from the center of its forehead.  Classical unicorns were technically not equines, having thin, almost [[deer]]-like bodies with cloven [[hoof|hooves]] and a [[lion]]-like, tufted tail.  The modern convention is to depict them as a standard [[horse]] with a horn on the forehead.

Some sources argue that the apparently single horn (known as an alicorn) is really a pair of horns growing spiraled tightly about one another.  Legend has it that a unicorn's horn can purify water and detect poison, thus making cups allegedly made from unicorn horns highly prized objects.  However, in reality, these cups are carved from other sources, such as [[narwhal]] teeth.

Since the Middle Ages, unicorns traditionally are said to be attracted to virgins and the morally pure, and were sometimes used as a symbol for Christ in medieval paintings.

The karkadan is a highly aggressive unicorn from Asia and Arabia possibly derived from a now extinct [[rhinoceros]].  The [[kirin]] is also often portrayed as a variety of unicorn in modern times, but the original versions possessed the standard two horns.  Other types of unicorn-like creatures also exist in folklore and legend, from the [[miraj]] to the Invisible Pink Unicorn.
__________

For the purposes of e621, unicorns are tagged as [[equine]] but should not be tagged as either [[horse]] or [[pony]].  If a creature is an equine and possesses both a horn and [[wings]], it should be tagged as [[winged unicorn]] instead.

project_x_love_potion_disaster,"thumb #330765
[i][b]Project X: Love Potion Disaster[/b][/i], or just Project X is a fan-made hentai side scrolling beat 'em up type [[video_game|game]] featuring characters from [[Sega]]'s [[Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(series)|Sonic the Hedgehog series]] and fan characters made by Zeta Team, the leaders of said team are [[NeoEclipse]] and [[Zeta R-02]] (also a pornographic artist).

The game was first released for free on November 20th, 2009. Despite being around for over a decade, the game is still incomplete and in-development hell, only receiving a major update once every 18-36 months. This is primarily due to the games status as a passion project, with the creators not charging players for the download or attempting subscription based payment via [[Patreon]] or [[SubscribeStar]]. Leading to most of the work getting done on the side while they have to take care of real-life issues. The ultimate goal of the creators is to have 8 major stages like most games in the series that it is based on.

The basic premise of the game is that while [[Dr. Eggman]] is attempting once again to take over the land, a pair of scientists making a love potion wind up using too much of the eponymous Element X. This results in a massive pink cloud covering the region that causes everyone including [[Child]]ren [[Plants]], [[Feral]] Animals, [[Robot]]s, [[alien]]s, and [[mythology|mythological creatures]] such as [[ghost]]s, [[mermaid]]s, and [[demon]]s; to become sex crazed zombies. This also leads to the birth of pink, [[crossgender]]ed, nymphomaniacal, version of [[chaos_(sonic)|Chaos]] known as Venus who seeks to spread the cloud's influence and force/seduce those affected to become part of her [[harem]] of boyfriends and girlfriends.

The player's character is one of the few characters mostly unaffected by the cloud and will attempt to find a way to reverse its effects. Originally the only playable character was Zeta-R02's [[fan character]] [[Zeta the Echidna]]. But over time they would come to add other characters from the main series including [[Blaze the Cat]], [[Amy Rose]], [[Rouge the Bat]], [[Cream the Rabbit]] and her sidekick [[Cheese the Chao]], and [[Miles_Prower|Tails the Fox]] as the token male. At one point, [[Rockcandy]]'s [[Zu]] was also a playable character. Conversely, most of the initial enemies were based on hostiles from the Sonic series such as the [[badnik]]s, [[dark gaia minion]]s, [[Boo_(Sonic)|Boom Boos]] and [[Chao]] before shifting to more original and unique enemies.

Game-play wise its a standard side-scrolling beat 'em up, with minimal platforming and unique stage design. Each of the playable characters has different stats such as jump, speed, strength, defense, and special move power. They each have a basic combo, a dash attack, a jumping attack, a ranged special, and an area of effect special. The player must defeat all the hostiles in the area within 90 seconds before moving on to the next. Enemies have different movement patterns, health bars, and even special attacks. If they get to close, they will remove the players clothes and one of two animations will play in which the enemy rapes the player's character and they take damage. Too much damage and you'll lose a life. Health can be replenished by collecting [[condom]]s and [[birth control]] [[pills]]. There are secret areas with challenges and puzzles to potentially earn [[Chaos Emerald]]s, which will increase maximum health and power. You can also score points with combos and by rescuing other [[fan_character|Mobians]] from the effects of the cloud. 

There are currently 5 completed stages. Most of the sound assets including music and voice acting is ripped from existing triple a games from in and outside of the Sonic series. There are also a number of pop-culture references ranging from Sonic to [[Spongebob Squarepants]], [[Street Fighter]], [[The Little Mermaid]], [[Ecco_the_Dolphin_(Series)|Ecco]], [[Darkstalkers]], and much more.

There are also additional game modes, including an Arena Mode where you fight hordes of enemies leading to a face off with evil (horny) versions of of the playable characters and then [[Big the Cat]], Boss Rush where you fight the game's bosses back-to-back, those bosses being [[Decoe]], [[Bocoe]], [[Bokkun]], a hedge of [[Piranha Plant]]s, [[Lah]] the Ghost, [[Sonic the Werehog]], [[Neokat]]'s OC's, [[Zeena]] of the [[Deadly Six]], [[Big the Cat]] and Venus.

Project X Covers a massive list of kinks and fetishes, including, [[Rape]], [[tentacles]], [[oral]], [[fisting]], [[vore]], [[bestiality]], [[cub]], [[hyper]], [[inflation]], [[cumflation]], [[worms]], [[knotting]], [[underwater sex]], [[impregnation]], [[unbirthing]], [[pegging]], [[tail sex]], [[cosplay]], [[transformation]], [[watersports]], [[bdsm]], [[spanking]], [[sex toy]]s, [[gender transformation]], [[intersex]], [[lactation]], [[goo]], [[oviposition]], [[flying sex]], unorthodox penetration, gay sex, lesbian sex, straight sex, [[group sex]], and much more.

billy_roll,"The [b]Billy Roll[/b] is a product made in 1986 by the Feldhues Group, a Germany-based company known for making sausages with decorative patterns when sliced. The Billy Roll (also known as the [b]Smiling Sausage[/b] or the [b]Meat Clown[/b]) specifically has the pattern of a [[clown]]'s [[smile|smiling face]]. The product is a popular sandwich filling in Ireland where it is sold more [i]per capita[/i] than anywhere else in Europe, and gained interest online in the later 2010s due to rise in popularity of clowns.

[b]Moji[/b] is a playable character in the hero shooter video game [b][i][[Paladins]][/i][/b] developed by Evil Mojo Games. She was released in [i]Paladins[/i] as part of the Open Beta 65 update, [i]Paladins and Friends[/i]. She is a [[blue eyes|blue eyed]], [[red fur|red furred]] Leipori, a [[rabbit|rabbit-like]] race with long ears and very short statures that live in huge caverns underneath the Enchanted Forest. In her default appearance she wears a dark blue [[robe]] that covers almost her entire body, a matching blue [[witch]] hat, white [[gloves]], [[glasses]], and a brown [[mask]] that covers her mouth. She is a Flank class champion who uses her two-headed magical familiar [b][[Po-Li]][/b] to ride into battle, blasting enemies with their magic breath. 

As the war between the Paladins and the Magistrate began, most of the Leipori fled into the forest to escape the conflict. Moji took it upon herself to enter the fray to protect nature and prevent its destruction. Riding on Po-Li's back, Moji uses her familiar's magical breath to deal damage to enemies at close range while casting shielding spells to protect herself. Her ultimate ability, Bon Appetit, has her cast a polymorphing spell to transform her enemies into a delicious treat which Po-Li can consume.

Like other [i]Paladins [/i]characters, Moji has several alternate skins that radically change her and Po-Li's appearance. Some of these include [b]Dragonborn Moji[/b], which gives her a different robe, short draconic [[horn|horns]], and a much more menacing looking dragon form for Po-Li, and [b]Cuddly Moji[/b], which changes her into a [[tan body|tan colored]] living [[plushie]]."

face_in_ass,"thumb #2765422 thumb #2465373 thumb #3024556

Use this tag whenever a character's face is near the [[anus]] region, or between the butt cheeks of another character. This concept includes [[facesitting]], and its variant themes, as well as most forms of [[rimming]].

This theme is commonly associated with [[humiliation]] content, but not always as this theme is associated with many forms of assplay, including [[anal vore]]. Less sexualized interactions should be tagged as [[head on butt]] (pressing, nuzzling, worship themes). Limited contact themes can be found in [[butt in face]] (presenting, teasing, imminent `face_in_ass` themed content).

As a note, characters tend to be drawn with enlarged butts in these types of themes. Expect to see sizes that range from [[big_butt|big]], to [[huge_butt|huge]], or even [[hyper_butt|bigger]]. [[Size difference]] is also common in `face_in_ass` themes.

Source: <https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sneasel_(Pokémon)>

Hisuian Sneasel is a [[regional_form_(pokémon)|regional form]] of [[Sneasel]] found in the Hisui region from [[pokemon_legends_arceus|Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]. While its Johtonian counterpart is Dark/Ice-type, Hisuian Sneasel is Fighting/Poison-type.

It evolves into [[Sneasler]] when exposed to a Razor Claw during the day.

Hisuian Sneasel has a similar appearance to its Johtonian counterpart due to the living environment on the cliffside. It has a white and purple body with its left ear colored light purple. The face, shoulders, and chest have dark purple spots and there is a yellow gem on both its head and chest. The two toes on each foot are closed, and it has rounder eyes than its Johtonian form. Like Johtonian Sneasel, the ear feather is shorter on the female than on the male.

Hisuian Sneasel's sturdy and curved claws allow it to climb and travel through the precipitous walls and cliffs where it lives. The venom from the tips of Hisuian Sneasel's claws is capable of invading the nervous system of any prey it scratches. It prefers to be alone, unlike the Johtonian Sneasel. It has been observed that Hisuian Sneasel lacks the spitefulness of its Johtonian counterpart, and it has been theorized that differences in its environment account for the differing personalities. As a result of these differences in environment, Hisuian Sneasel evolves into Sneasler instead of Weavile.

h5. What Are ""[i]Medium[/i]"" Breasts?

Here are some attributes of ""medium"" sized breasts:
* Typically perky, with little [[sagging_breasts|sag]] even when unsupported
* Unlike big breasts, there is usually distinct space on the chest between the breasts when exposed, and often minimal [[cleavage]] when clothed
* Unlike small breasts, they are distinct masses on the chest, if the breasts are only defined by hatched lines suggesting their shape, and they aren't clearly lined, it's more likely the character has [[small breasts]]
* Most often seen on [[athletic]], [[slim]] and [[skinny]] body types, chubby and overweight characters with medium breasts are often [[pear-shaped figure|pear bodied]]

[i]Even with the above in mind, distinguishing medium breasts from the ""smaller"" side of [i]big breasts[/i] in particular can be difficult and subjective, use your best judgment.[/i]

Source: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rhydon_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29

Rhydon (Japanese: サイドン Sidon) is a dual-type Ground/Rock Pokémon.

It evolves from Rhyhorn starting at level 42 and evolves into Rhyperior when traded holding a Protector. 

Rhydon is a large, gray, bipedal Pokémon with features of both dinosaurs and rhinoceroses. It has a cream-colored, drill-like horn on its snout, the female having a smaller horn than the male. There are other protrusions on the head as well, including a spike curving forward from the middle of its head, two triangular, points resembling ears to the sides, a wide, wavy crest under the ears, and spiky ridges on its cheeks. It has red eyes and two fangs protruding from its upper jaw. It has a cream-colored stomach and a row of spikes down its back. Rhydon has a long tail with skinny, black stripes.

Rhydon is a physically powerful Pokémon. It is recorded as being able to topple buildings with a sweeping blow of its tail, and its horn is able to bore through solid rock and shatter diamonds. Rhydon is protected from heat and physical blows by its armor-like hide. It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Rhydon has a well-developed brain, but can also be forgetful. It lives in rough terrain.

When a character's naked crotch is visible on the post but their genitals are nowhere to be seen on that area.

h4.Reasons
* The artist wants to keep the post [[rating:safe|safe for work]] and omitted rendering them.
* The character in question canonically lacks genitals due to being born without one ([[null]]).
* The character had genitals once but has somehow lost them ([[nullo]]).
* The character somehow has the ability to hide their genitals.
* The character has an [[unusual genitalia placement]].

h4.For Tagging Purposes
* The crotch area must be visible in view and not obscured. Having someone being [[bottomless]] but their [[crossed legs|legs are crossed]] or is [[covering_crotch|covering their crotch]] doesn't warrant this tag.
* If there is evidence indicating that the character canonically lacks genitals, rather than genitals simply being not drawn, [[null]] should be tagged as well.
* If there's evidence that the genitals were removed then [[nullo]] should be used instead.
* Note that not all characters with a featureless crotch are nulls or nullos as they may have their genitals [[unusual genitalia placement|located somewhere else]] on their body.

coremata,"Coremata, singularly referred to as corema, are distinctive anatomical features observed in male moths. These structures, which are both eversible and inflatable, are internally stored and unfurl to expose the [[hair-pencils]] contained within.

However, artistic liberties and [[TWYS]] should be taken into account; if an image depicts a creature ejaculating from or using a corema for penetration, it should still be tagged with [[penis]] for search purposes."
