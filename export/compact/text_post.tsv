4010	100624	@Gilda_The_Gryphon Thank you for sourcing my uploads. I didn't have them sourced on upload because they are higher res versions than the sourced ones, and I can't upload an image with the same source as another image.

It's like having a sfw filter on just the images, because it only shows the images that are rated ""Safe"". Explicit and questionable rated images aren't on there. Nsfw thumbs (pfp, embeds on wiki pages, etc) will show as a 'deleted' thumb, if I remember right. The text, wiki, comments, forum etc can still show mixed topics, so it's not completely sfw. But it's one way to browse for only images with the Safe rating. A link to a post on e926 is also on here, just switch the ""e926"" part of the URL to be ""e621"" instead. It's roughly like a sfw images only pre-filtered-version of e621, rather than being truly separate. "

30893	105815	It happens with tag scripts too. If you open a thumb into a new tab, then script it, then later edit the tabbed one without a refresh, you can even undo your own work.So refresh pages often to prevent nuking edits were after it was loaded.	
30793	105815	Also to avoid this bug: if you have an image open for awhile before you got around to editing the tags, please refresh the image first before editing the tags. That way it won't nuke any tags which were added since you loaded the page. 	
30463	105815	technically hazel eyes means a brown/green mix, though some people think it means a fancy way of saying brown because they're thinking of the nuts. Like many words, context changes meaning. That confusion may be why it was aliased away? =/

24785	105815	@Xch3l: I know the feeling. But the message you have to say is pretty important, right? An imperfect try is better than nothing at all. I wouldn't dwell too long on finding the perfect words, there may not be a perfect way to say it. Just give it a try.	
24780	105815	@Xch3l:Anticipation and thinking about it beforehand can be brutal. But when something needs to be said, it can be a huge relief once it's done since dealing with it becomes the easier part. So sometimes it helps to keep that in mind. 	
24779	105815	@Durandal:I can understand that. Sounds like you may just need a new hobby, or reignite passion in an old one. It happens. I still think bees are awesome though. Bumblebees are my favorite. 	
24757	105815	@Durandal:That's possible. But experience tells me it's far more likely you just get excited about other stuff instead. Nothing wrong with having a different set of interests. Hey, weren't you the guy who likes bees? bees =/= boring.

After thoroughly cleaning my room, scouring through all my drawers and ""looking"" through my armoire, I found it actually in my armoire, behind my PS3 and Xbox 360. It was in a place I couldn't otherwise see, I simply thought ""I haven't moved these consoles yet"" and reached behind them to look...The worst part is, I bought a cord for my PS3 controller thinking that it was my PS4 controller, and I had thought I lost my 3DS earlier just because I didn't notice it on my nightstand. I really need to put my electronics in a box or 2, so this stops happening."

108091	108459	@Doomguy666: I actually discovered a bug really early on, with the help of another user on Discord to confirm it. When you fight the gibdo in Sagnol's tomb, if you despawn it (such as by dying)  the gibdo never respawns. This locks you out of Sagnol's bracelet, an important item. Ergo, you softlock the save file, since the bracelet is needed to progress and no other way to get it..Fortunately, the bug is encountered early enough that you can start another save file and try again, but it can reoccur and continue to interfere with your play through. I stopped at this bug as a result, but the romhack creator is aware of this and intends on fixing it (or AFAIK).	
108085	108459	I finally figured out how to set a Xbox controller for use in Project64!

I noticed TMoT's graphic quality is a slightly poor, but are there other things I should be aware of?

God, why do I even miss you?What a coincidence, I am gonna throw away my own laptop too. I cannot stand the fact that it's got 4 GB of RAM and is a piece of crap that's falling apart.

103310	130874	@Siral_Exan: I'm eventually going to, but I'd like to gather up more examples first because my issue here is non specific, and this was only the most recent offender in a long list of my criticisms with some of the staff.

103303	130874	And with that reasoning, this should be deleted as well since theres no discernable way to tell that the tendrils are connected to the head, or just the mask, thus you can't tell if it isn't human https://e621.net/post/show/1746032

103283	130874	My problem isn't the image being deleted, it's the general lack of consistency with the site staff when it comes to approvals, deletions, etc.There's precedence that humanoids are allowed, but it seems that staff are picking and choosing arbitrarily. 	
103282	130874	@Mairo: Uh, I don't know? Maybe the protrusions from under the hood, signifying that they are indeed connected to her skull?You might as well clean up the elf, vampire, fairy and other fantasy race tags as well. Or just anything under humanoid.	
103268	130874	@NotMeNotYou: They're not tentacles, they're fleshy tendrils that are a stand in for hair and don't do anything, like a Predator's dreadlocks. And the other images aren't grandfathered in, they're all pretty new. She'd fall under humanoid alien.	
103255	130874	@NotMeNotYou:Then why keep the other 200+ images of Ahsoka?And by that logic all elf images should be taken down because they're just humans with fancy ears.Where's the line? Where's the consistency?

59780	14449	@R-U-S-T-Y: Yeah, I was just referring to cannabis/ganja/marihuana (which is the most instantly associated with the term 'getting high' in everyday speech), and then I thought he did too. My bad perhaps. ^^	
59777	14449	@Fenrick: Weird, pot is supposed to make you mellow and giggly and stuff, definitely not put you in the mood to play creepy molester / serial killer. Though you can get an anxiety bout if you smoke while really stressed or fatigued. Maybe that happened?	
59775	14449	@Fenrick: Also because being high is still fun, being really drunk ain't. The journey is but the destination tends to disappoint. 	
59774	14449	@Fenrick: Ehh, it can be fun from time to time, in a controlled environment. But I generally don't drink to get drunk, so I usually avoid overdoing it. Getting high is far better, less chance of crap going awry in some way (and.. collatoral damage). 	
59770	14449	@DJ-WOLFBEAT5: And the weirdest part is saying and doing all kinds of stuff you wouldn't even consider normally, and... not giving a single shit. -Worst- part is when you inevitably get nauseous and have to fight the urge to puke all over the place. D:

59750	14449	@Naysayer1230: So please, try to beat these fears and seek the help you need. I guarantee it won't leave you lonely, because once you're positive and spirited, you're bound to attract more people than the few that maybe notice you right now out of pity. 	
59749	14449	@Naysayer1230: I do understand what causes you to do this, and believe me when I say I wish you the best (and that you matter!), but playing along here won't make you feel better in the long run. And that idea alone is frustrating, you see?

59744	14449	@Ratte: I mean, I do feel for them, but beyond a few supportive kind words there's really nothing I can do for them that's substantial. I'm just a spectator. Not implying you shouldn't even bother us with it, but... what do you actually want us to say? =/	
59743	14449	@Ratte: Bit harsh perhaps, but you're right. Candy bar says he won't, though. I've seen multiple depressed people here over time, and continuously wallowing in self-pity always seems preferable to them over seeking out a trained professional for help.

58637	14449	@NotMeNotYou: Keeping your skin taut definitely helps, but when trying to banish hair from an entire leg, you really don't want to do that little by little. It's not like I can choose which hairs it rips out, anyway. Plus, they all need to go.

58074	14449	@The_Diggler: Toei's a laugh really. They possess one of the largest (and money-ensuring) franchises in anime, have it make a return after decades and then totally skimp on the animators, putting cheap and inexperienced studios under huge time pressure.	
58073	14449	@The_Diggler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfHBrhMM5bkThat vid does a pretty good job highlighting the problems with DBS' visuals.

56370	14449	@furballs_dc: Interesting vid! It's mind-boggling why Sega made the Saturn so overly complex, but at the same time I love it for it, cause its infrastructure is something of an antithesis of modern consoles that are just a box with cheap PC parts!

54855	14449	@Lance_Armstrong: Also, I can't be bothered about a whited out navigation button when there's the awesomeness of not having those connected to the pool title anymore. Means they're consistently placed and can't skip to the next line. Now THAT was ugly.	
54854	14449	@Lance_Armstrong: I don't know, but previously (for me) the page would slightly jump downward once a pic was done loading, even if it was in the same position as the previous. That's gone now. Don't know if that was intentional, but it works for me.	
54850	14449	@Ratte: OMG I love the updated pool interface and particularly how the pages don't move about anymore when loading a pic, so I can just navigate through a bunch of them without misclicking!

So much for the Word of God.We could talk about Sodom and Gomorrah, but that story is so morally dubious for all parties involved that I don't understand why Christians even take it into consideration.And I use the word ""fascists"" because people bigoted enough to ""cancel"" someone over drawing a rainbow usually have other extreme right-wing beliefs.For example, believing that gay people must be ""forcibly converted"", and failing that – killed."	
123080	160505	Xappol-Dreamberry said: ... Ah, I see that you are a fan of the Book of Leviticus. I presume you also despise people who break its other prohibitions too, like:Letting your hair become unkempt (10:6)Eating any seafood without fins or scales (11:10-12)Mixing fabrics in clothing (19:19)Trimming your beard (19:27)Cutting your hair at the sides (19:27)Getting tattoos (19:28)Mistreating foreigners (19:33-34)Working on the Sabbath (23:3)Selling land permanently (25:23)Or is it just homosexuality that you hate?Not lesbians, mind you. Leviticus says nothing about them.No mention of trans people either, for that matter.And as for your other argument, I'm glad to know where you stand.That you would rather bend over backwards to appease fascists rather than risk offending them.Then again, it sure is convenient that you also object to the thing that would offend them. You have that in common.	
123078	160505	"Yes, I too am familiar with the concept of ""paradox of tolerance"".The answer to that is that if we wish to build a fair and just society, we cannot permit intolerance.Demagogues would consider that a contradiction. Reasonable people would consider that necessary.If depicting rainbows makes you uncomfortable, that is a problem with you. It is not about being a Christian. In the Bible, a rainbow is one of the symbols of God's love for us.The ideology that causes some Christians to despise LGBT people has very little to do with Christ's teachings. The Bible does not really support that – traditions do.If I were you, I would question why you should be peer pressured by dead people.I am not a liberal, by the way. Not sure where you got that from.But that's besides the point."

6592	16311	@Renard_Queenston: I'm not against anime, though I want it to have non-human characters not as a mere joke characters.You're not trying to convince me to watch pokemon anime, are you? Even the first episode of origin was disappointing.

One of them was literally just for adding the tag at all, I didn't add it back and the user decided to throw insults at me in dmail.

The next one I got was ""waterproof"" and when it got dirty I just ran it under water to clean it and it was fine the first time but the second time it didn't respond after its shower. The next one was the nicest one I ever used and I was so upset when it broke that the maker Horsky just didn't seem to exsist anymore, but anyway what happened to it is that the right shift key broke off on it and I actually still have that one in a bin under my bed in hopes of fixing it. The last one that just broke decided to unalive itself for seemingly no reason a few days after the backlight stopped working. "

Or 121 betta fish.

I wasn't sure what was causing it so I started paying attention to what was open when it starts to happen and I've pinned it to deviantart tabs.

67149	174059	It was raining heavily today, so I went to the theaters instead of playing Pokémon GO.I saw Split and The Lego Batman Movie. One is a return to form, and another is a heartfelt progression. Both enjoyable and recommended to see.	
67148	174059	@Queen_Tyr'ahnee: Neat. There's still no value for it competitively. Not until it's at least Lv.50. But at least it has value as a trophy to keep or to trade.The GTS initiated must be wiser with which Pokémon to request now.	
67134	174059	@Aanyi: If you played Pokémon GO, you probably would've benefitted more out of it.	
67133	174059	@Queen_Tyr'ahnee: Well, I already have a 5 IV Salamence and I was given a Munchlax with a Z crystal, which I used for most of the game.Low level, huh. Maybe the twats on GTS will lessen with their ridiculous trade requirements.

67118	174059	@Syderen:Last I checked, the author of that monster-sized fanfic is in college. Or perhaps he graduated.And English isn't his primary language, which is why his grammar and story structure is flat for the first ten chapters or so.

I checked and you haven't finished the process, they never received the requested identification. You can still try again, the ability to get your ban fixed is still very much open.Same for us, now.	
107629	17633	@Kai_Rose: Your complete disregard of our uploading guidelines was the reason we took your ability to upload, and your conduct here is the reason why you won't be getting it back.

103693	17633	@Samael_Morningstar: Oh, just the fact that you're dishonest, like for example claiming art you didn't make as your own, or tracing over stuff on your old account.Nothing of what you've done paints you as a sincere person, is all.	
103673	17633	Sharp Coyote said:The question from Samael was a tad ... flippant ... and was answered thusly.That's a very fair point, and Kristal Candeo isn't exactly known for sincerity.	
103654	17633	@Sharp_Coyote: That's surprisingly dismissive of a whole host of things coming from you. Some people's brains just aren't wired to make it feel great, the same way some people's brains aren't wired to supply adequate serotonin without help.

103170	17633	@Chameloshi: Do you have a 360S without the internal drive? If yes that's likely the problem, and the packaging of the game should have mentioned it needs an HDD.

102072	17633	@CaveStory: The blip Chaser referenced was public for slightly more than 4 hours before you hid it. Do you expect people to continuously check whether you tried to redact something before recalling it from memory?	
102065	17633	@CaveStory: I'm talking about the report against chaser, where you yourself quite literally said he's trying to instigate something by calling you out in the blips.Reports you made about creepy comments offer no context for this part of the equation.	
102063	17633	@CaveStory: I know the full context quite well, this isn't the first time you've resorted to reporting people because they called you out on something.While Chaser wasn't intended target, it was in public so anyone can pick it up and call you out on it.	
102058	17633	CaveStory said:How tf do people keep getting away with being instigators with no penalties? I have seen this happen plenty of times now.Because you always threw the first stone and they just hand it back to you.

100882	17633	@Kemonophonic: My personal recommendation would be a working one. After that how about trying a few out at a local music equipment store? They could definitely help you pick one suited for your needs, and let you test them in person.

100401	17633	@Chameloshi: Because the original games started out as GB games, and only had palettes for some compatibility to the Super GameBoy and GameBoy Color, they're not true GameBoy Color games.Also file sizes, the games barely fit on the cartridges as is.

87854	183140	@CCoyote: and my response was “how were those comments a violation of the rules”. Stop deflecting. And you keep talking about “being civil”, because of course you have no idea what the situation was. The user wasn’t banned for insulting people.	
87851	183140	@CCoyote: yes of course. “Whatever”. Important to chime in until someone pushes back, then it’s on to being dismissive.

115524	188876	Aw snap E-01 is mass uploading. Party time!	
114993	188876	@Odisaodi I challenge you to boop another derg since you pretty much @everyone and hugged them all on Milli’s server	
114778	188876	I have one slight gripe with e621 posting. It no longer shows the posted of the images now. I kinda would like to see who posted what without looking at TAG HISTORY of all things. Yes even with the crappy new UI I care more about that old feature then the accidental ad clicking from me trying to continue in pools.	
114689	188876	I’m tired of the drama on my pfp post. Why is flat justice so difficult…	
114373	188876	Wanna know what would be the biggest brain play? Making Rivet a femboy. Think about it. Lombax anatomy says that female Lombax do not have tails. On top of this the definition of Rivet is a short metal pin or bolt for holding… And the pin is a metallic rod like object.Essentially tricking all who don’t realize this.Also if this does happen I weep for the taggers now having to go out and retag everything as “crossgender.”	
114207	188876	Hey what’s going on here? I keep having to enter Captcha’s every time I leave and come back.	
113935	188876	Decided to visit an old part of the site. A very infamous old part of the site. Man history is interesting.	
113700	188876	Thank you to the silli handsome dergon for joining my stream.	
113580	188876	Got my second vaccine shot yesterday. Feeling like shit today.	
113447	188876	Sorry about that @KemonophonicAnd to whoever closes the thread	
113445	188876	Still waiting my turn in an artist’s line for Midnight Eternal so I’m gonna focus a little more on S.I.M.P.	
113444	188876	It’s official. I lost track of how many ads I accidentally clicked because of the dumb UI.

112741	188876	So I have to hold off on Midnight Eternal because I apparently skipped a page and I have to wait a whole month or two until I’m able to fix that issue... *insane panda noises*Anyways while there currently on pause for now. However I am also working on another thing that’s been in my files for months. S.I.M.P.Just an image set that I’ve been sitting on for quite a bit.

I may not be one to speak because I’ve been marked too but that doesn’t mean I can’t still try to be upstanding. Please understand that conflict is not necessary and would make things worse. 	
112680	188876	The Noir based Midnight Eternal Image set I have planned has reached its halfway mark. Ending off at the calm before the storm. I’ll upload as soon as story beats have been written.	
112545	188876	@Odisaodi: I mean I do plan on having a Mouse with a Mauser but she’s not been drawn with that yet. Just found it amusing someone beat me to the punch.

84568	191432	@MetalFoxT: Yes. The ones you uploaded were lower quality (1280x938). FA downscales everything to that.To avoid this, I recommend uploading it straight from the computer, instead of downloading it after uploading it somewhere, as most sites alter them

121499	205103	I watched a really creepy Kirby movie like 10 Years ago, and I can’t find it anywhere anymore. There was some really startling information in that movie. Apparently Kirby might not be awake in any of the games you play (aside from SSB).Kirby ends up fighting this dude who has darkness powers or something, but it’s not one of the final bosses or anything. The enemy rides on some sort of technology to fly, and ends up sending Kirby into an eternal slumber… or at least that’s how I saw it. Let’s not forget that Kirby’s adventures take place in “Dreamland” for crying out loud!Game Theory and Matpat would go nuts over this!!

120673	205103	To those of you out there who are feeling generous Today, one of e621’s finest artists (in my opinion) has been having a medical nightmare.Here’s a link to Digitoxici’s post!https://www.furaffinity.net/view/49023389/

The people you see who’s favorites go beyond 100,000 and have joined the same Year as I have are definitely just spamming the fave-button.

119602	205103	So I’ve been working on a unique Dragon language inspired by Danish, Swedish & Latin dialects. I’ve got a lot of common words covered, but I still want to add more.How about some of you tell me which words I should add next? Not actual Dragon words, but ordinary words I can make into Dragon language!garfieldfromgarfield said:Do you have the stereotypical dragon words already? Words like gold, hoard, uhhh...dragon, wings, cave, that kind of stuff? What about words for other races? Emotions?Yes, I have most of those words. Though I’m thinking of adding words that are less common, but can still be associated with their surroundings, like “cactus/cacti” (Sakten/Sakteni), or “Omnipotent” (Mayazaim) each as an example. Languages are fun to create, especially if they’re associated with Dragons! I’ve already made unique suffixes and prefixes as well, which makes developing the rest of the language much easier.

118972	205103	My mind is trying to recall a memory, but something’s very off.It’s a very fleeting moment of an event suddenly flashing halfway, then disappearing just as quickly. At first, I thought I was just trying to remember an interesting story podcast, or maybe a movie I watched a few Years ago. However, something just doesn’t feel right. The events are all different, and incredibly familiar, but also don’t match any feelings that reality (or fiction) have ever given me. It’s like a different energy and essence altogether. Even now, small chunks keep flashing across my mind, and it bothers me, since I can’t hold onto it. I could’ve just shrugged it off as one of those things where your mind almost remembers something familiar, then it never happens again for the next Month or so, but it’s been happening all Day and Night! This has never happened before, and it’s not stopping! Has anyone gotten anything like this before? If you have, please tell me!

I’m feeling weak, I have very dry throat, I’m not thinking clearly, and I don’t feel like browsing furry porn (That last one is likely the most concerning).

It can be fun, but sometimes it gets unnecessarily real. Then it comes down to question why I’d even daydream in the first place, seeing how it beats the point of escaping reality.

70416	208751	its weird how this site can allow the same 2 images to be uploaded which then share next to no differences other then the possible difference of metadata from the img's themselves *shrug* heres hoping the one that was uploaded a full hour before stays lol	
69234	208751	Huh odd i can't upload a better version of a image thats already on site because the better version was uploaded then deleted over year ago? maybe someone can help me about this?	
67567	208751	kinda annoying that someone replies to something after 6 months of nothing just to start shit and they are let off lmao	
65531	208751	ughh i love finding out an artist has a twitter and its all better quality then the stuff they upload to places like FA after i uploaded some of the missing pieces from their gallery... welp time to hunt for the things i uploaded so i can re-upload them 	
63910	208751	Seems like the personal way I tag seems problematic whoops!	
63434	208751	its never a good night when you accidentally uploaded the wrong quality version of a image twice 	
57753	208751	oh sweet past 3000 tag edits	
57069	208751	OH hey, i hit 100 post cap, Hurrah!	
56279	208751	I'm both excited and not excited for the release of Ana in Overwatch RIP healing teammates 	
56196	208751	Rip 1100+ posts and 2500+ tag edits	
56195	208751	@@Eppleblam: yeah lmfao, its not even that hard to edit the tags thats my favorite thing too, whats worse is when they get pissy about either the lack of tags or the fact they hate it and don't for whatever reason have it black listed	
56179	208751	I never seem to understand why people complain about tags and then not do anything about it lol, or when people complain about seeing something that they clearly don't like and don't blacklist it lmao	
56055	208751	Huh i just realized i past 1000 posts shortly agoyay!	
55288	208751	Sweet 4th day of rain in a row

47839	208751	Wow this wind makes a ton of noise	
47831	208751	love how a majority of my uploads got deleted because of some crazy person with a grudge against me decided he had the more right because hes a higher rankokay sure	
47804	208751	Mutisija said:@Pawsinmotion: i checked the galleries and these images were not uploaded there in this big sizes.again third party sites, and if someone can prove me wrong the kudos but until then wait for a admin	
47802	208751	@Mutisija well dude idk what i did to piss you off but stop crying wolf you literally have no full out proof that its paid art there are sites that are able to host imgs in such sizes as the ones i've uploaded you lack just as much proof as i do so	
47798	208751	tbh i kinda hate it when someone is a higher rank and they think just because of that rank they are right and you're wrong :/Gotta love when people jump their guns without talking first lollike chill honestly

100611	211950	@Millcore: Thanks for uploading post #2049117 . I noticed you included a/p/a/ tag which confused others. (one post tagged with a/p/a/) Image seems to depict anthro_penetrating_anthro so that's what i changed tag to. Is some other a/p/a/ in image?

81396	21257	No more translation_request tags in 2007. Bye-bye! I'm thinking 2008 will take a week, and only for a handful of posts.	
81354	21257	ErionDelta said:@wous: I do hope you mean 2017 and 2018...Pft, no.Until just a little while ago there were some translation_request tags on eleven year old posts. I'm ending that all.	
81350	21257	It's been a decent week for translation, folks. Nearly all of the 2007 requests are gone now. After all these years it feels weird to be saying that. 2008 is going to be a hoot.Good work @Somnax:, @theultra:, and @anonymousanalogue: for your part. 	
81323	21257	August 4th 2007 was a real mess of translation_requests. Let's see if I can sort that out once and for all today.

79954	21257	I'm missing a lot of the old translators that have come and gone. I wish I could just recall them en masse so we could crush translation_request under our combined glory for a week.

79824	21257	@NotMeNotYou: Well whatever the reason or method, they are bound to the posts the notes are on rather than the notes themselves. Checking up on it, they change more constantly than I thought. It's been shades of red for the past three days though.	
79821	21257	@NotMeNotYou: @Oberschutze: Actually, the colors correspond to the date of the post that the note is on. The color changes very slightly for every day that passes. The color isn't influenced by the notes themselves at all.	
79804	21257	@Chaser: I think I was using up the very last of the space. The translation notes that the site would accept kept getting smaller and smaller until not even four letters worked.	
79737	21257	@Nicklo6649: Grats on the upgrade. Keep it up.

79439	21257	@DigitalHare: Oho, no problem, though I was only just finishing it as you said. The original poster, @Lafcadio, did a fine job of like 3/4 of the whole thing before where I started, in addition to pooling it, and adding a translated description.	
79415	21257	@Axolotl: It was one post and it was renoting, but it was a tough arrangement none the less. It was more in one shot than 99% of the userbase does with notes ever. You belong in there with the rest. 	
79397	21257	For superior note handling @Asza3250:, @Axolotl:, @Mairo:, and @Somnax: get the 〔《([※])》〕 of Power.For tranlation_requests tags @HopefulSpark: and @theultra: get the 🐰 of Importance.@Clawstripe: and @SnowWolf: also get ⛎ of #13 for some reason.

I'd say things are going pretty well.	
118082	215902	Wow. It's been a very, VERY long time since I've ever received a DMail from this place in my regular email box, probably about 5 years. And what spectacular interaction was it? Probably the last ever person to contact me about a misunderstanding about me removing their neutral record and not adding one. Back then I received dozens upon dozens of these, and this one happens to be one extreme outlier.Oh, and apparently the blip character limit has been increased somewhere down the line after all. Ages ago when I proposed it, I was bombarded with negative reactions... Heh

103828	221073	I've watched so many KSP mod videos that I genuinely want to make a planet mod even though I'm grossly underqualified to do such a thing for so many reasons	
103172	221073	@NotMeNotYou: yes, it doesn't have anything in the HDD slot, most likely because it was a pre-owned Christmas gift from my brotherAnd I also didn't even know that an HDD was required for anything whatsoever, which is why I didn't read the box	
103169	221073	As it turns out, the Gamestop I bought Fallout 3 from didnt even have any HDDs for the 360 S, so buying one was out of the question even if they were cheap, so returning the game was the only thing I could do	
103160	221073	@Kemonophonic: I shouldn't have to buy an optional accessory to play the game, I pretty much have no choice but to return the game for a refund since buying an HDD for the 360S is out of the question due to money	
103150	221073	Okay, who at Microsoft thought it was a good idea to make the DLC of Fallout 3 require an external hard drive? I'm pretty sure I wasted my money on a game I can't even play and HHDs for the 360s aren't even remotely cheap 	
102556	221073	The most powerful video game characters in existence are the trucks in Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing	
102401	221073	Well I just found out that in New Vegas' Old World Blues DLC, my character was able to survive Gabe's death explosion from five feet awayI'm currently around level 27 and all I was wearing was the rebreather and Grahams armor	
102377	221073	Okay so on Discord for Android, if you tap the dark mode option about 6-10 times, you'll unlock an option that turns the background completely blackI'm not sure if it works on other platforms	
102343	221073	@Kemonophonic: I'll probably try to take everything in the vault some other time with a build suited for such a feat... if I even get myself to do the DLC againThe weapons and lore are good, it's just that the mechanics are stupid and hard	
102339	221073	I managed to successfully save all three companions in the Dead Money DLC of New VegasI couldn't trap Elijah in the vault though	
102286	221073	@Kemonophonic: My current file is only like, ~15 hours I think and I'm around level 23, but I already have maxed speech and guns skills with max charisma and strength. I'm unnaturally good at saving caps as I currently have almost 30,000	
102285	221073	@vex714: I think I'll stick with This Machine since .308 ammo is easier to come by and the slightly better damage for bypassing DT, but like any unique weapon I come across, I won't get rid of the Survivalist Rifle	
102280	221073	@vex714: I actually did pick that up, and I'm honestly torn between using it or keeping This Machine since they both carry similar roles	
102276	221073	I finished the Honest Hearts DLC in New Vegas today, and I left with so much loot that I went to the Vendortron, bought an LMG, a riot shotgun, a lot of ammo, cleared out all 8000 of it's caps, and I still had loot left over

99817	221073	I think the entirety of the Metal Gear series was all Major Zero's fault, correct me if I'm wrong	
99442	221073	@Chaser: I'm not sure if that's the case, but it happens at random times on some nights regardless of channel, it always reverts when I change the channel, and proper EAS alerts work normallyIts also a Spectrum cable box, if that means anything	
90864	221073	I forced 100 Minecraft players to build the Tower of Babel and then tried to punish them for their hubris but I learned that you can't fast travel when hot singles are in your area	
99429	221073	My TV did that thing again where it cuts to black and plays an incomplete EAS tone, but this time, instead of the first three and last three beeps like usual, it did the first three beeps and the long beep but the long beep didn't stop

98642	221073	I managed to randomly come across the crafting plans of an MG42 in Fallout 76 today, which I found in a half buried safe in a hilltop graveyardThose plans easily cost more than 3500 caps at a vendor

97146	221073	@vex714: I've power cycled the cable box in the past and it still happens regardless, and it only happens on whichever channel it's on at the time@Doomguy666: We don't have satellite, it's Spectrum digital, and actual signal loss doesn't do EAS	
97142	221073	@vex714: I doubt it either of those things, because the screen cuts to black and plays a non-complete version of the EAS sound, but nothing else plays afterwards, changing channels reverts the black screen, and it happens at non-specific hours	
97135	221073	I have no idea why my cable keeps deciding to wake me up with a cut to black and a modified EAS tone at 3-4 AM on random nights, it's just two long tones and two short ones instead of the normal full toneI fucking hate it

102113	22273	@Rowan_Bojog: You do realize that blips are entirely public, and not like profile comments. When you post a blip, most will see it as start of public discussion because of how they are publicly broadcasted for whole site.

101735	22273	@HerManiac: Pro tip: people are allowed to comment any post they want regardless of how old it is. Necroing ancient forum threads for no reason, or restarting old drama is a different thing though. But just commenting on old posts is perfectly fine.

99947	22273	Also the contents of your feed is entirely up to your own choices. If you do not want to look at art of artists who draw only women, then do not watch artists who draw only women. Watch artists who draw men if that's what you want to see.	
99946	22273	@CuauhtemocI5MAL: When an artist draws mostly just women, it's rarely because they think that women are better. It's usually just that the artist finds women sexy. Especially if we are talking about furry art sites.	
99895	22273	@Jack-O's_Box: Did you already forget that your upload limit was manually killed to stop you from posting here?

99304	22273	@Jack-O's_Box: I do not know how to tell this to you, but publicly posting extremely graphic and violent descriptions of killing/harming yourself is kinda inappropriate.	
99250	22273	@CaveStory: What?	
99247	22273	@CaveStory: Nobody deletes posts just because uploader asked for approval. Usually posts sit unapproved because they are bad, and when uploader asks for their approval, someone checks it out and deletes them for being bad.

98999	22273	@Jack-O's_Box: Well one thing that is sure is that you have ran out of chances here since your upload limit got nuked.	
98948	22273	@roxashikari: Good for you?	
98612	22273	@KabbleLukan: The whole point of the upload limit system is to give punishment for bad uploads and reward for good uploads. It's not unfair to punish for uploading low quality content.	
98451	22273	@Funnyusername: lol bye.

98143	22273	@ListerTheSquirrel: It seems to me that the takedown requested all posts of Paddington to be removed. The cdnp status (which was most likely created only to avoid repeat of this) does not mean that the request of the takedown could be selectively ignored.

111352	228918	So I lost a friend recently. Not to death, thankfully. To my own assholish behaviour. Now I can accept that my friend doesn't forgive me. If the roles were reversed, I'd have done the same. I only ever talked about myself. Sure, I didn't know what else there was, since I didn't know any common interests, but all I had to do was ask. I'm not asking for advice on how to rebuild our friendship. It's over. And it's my fault. Nor am I asking about forming new ones. I have that information. It's not social or mental or moral advice I'm looking for.I never did any giving in that friendship. And I wasn't even thinking about it at the time. How do I know I haven't been bringing others down too? What if my parents are right about me, that I am a narcissist?

The whole time all I could think was the entire episode would have been non existent if the boss had given the team a fucking dossier. (Or at least didn't pretend that it was a job aimed at just killing a truly innocent person for no reason and ruin a good family.)I suppose it was technically Loona's job since the pilot said she was the one making sure they get ""the correct info on the target"", but I'm sure if Moxy simply knew that the target was being killed for the reasons she was, he would have been on board and not fucked it up. And for that he would not have even needed to read the whole dossier, just a brief summary. ""Contract Summary: Client wants target dead cause blah."" blitzo doesnt understand that anyone *would* care about the reason, and loona doesn't care enough to actually do anything beyond what she absolutely has to do"	
109109	228918	~WolfyTheWolf~ said:True... Though not everyone has or uses discord. And besides, this site already has a forum. Why not just add a thread for it?

109108	228918	"G0wther said:@kamimatsu: I think the term for that is ""psychological reactence""?Basically, people don't like to be told that they can't have something, in this case it's seeing an asexual character have sex or be portrayed sexually. So the natural response is to make the character have sex anyway. Also in this case, since the reason seems unfair or completely arbitrary, it just feels like the only way to not be 'controlled' by the creator for a 'stupid reason' that 'makes no sense in the first place' is by rebelling and making it happen regardless. In lamen's terms, just think of the classic situation where someone says not to do something and the other says ""you don't own me!"" and they proceed to do said thing.god i hate that this makes sense"

109077	228918	G0wther said:Can anyone explain to me the appeal of gay people, or more specifically gay characters to wear rainbow colored stuff like rainbow stripped socks/stockings and underwear and stuff? I know it's representative of gay pride and all, but why is it seen as attractive to display it in such a blatant manner through sexy clothing? I have no problem with a person or character being proud of it (cause they should be), but I just want to know why it's appealing to viewers is all, especially in gay [furry] art where it should be obvious anyway. Does it turn people on more or something?im still trying to figure out why, whenever there's an ace character, they always have the most porn drawn of them.

107692	228918	I may have found my strength in writing. The problem is it is against the very basis of writing. Situations where a tragedy really DOES happen for no reason, realistic villains who really DO have no reason, and the guarantee that, no, there will be no release from the building tension. That this continues because we lost our ability to empathize, which really DID happen for no reason.	
107536	228918	CCoyote said:Absolutely agreed. It's very hard for me to dredge up respect for anybody who kills for fun. They can rationalize all day about how their blood-soaked passtime brings thousands of dollars to poor villages, but I don't buy it. It's an excuse to take the edge off a spoiled person's gross selfishness.what about the ultimate irony of having the prey be another hunter who kills for sport, and vice versa? of course, those who hunt for food would be exempt, especially if they are respectful to their food (using every part, making sure it's quick, etc.) it is, after all, important to respect the one who feeds you, and that still holds true if the one that feeds you is a wild animal

106572	228918	@Jakku_NoShi: the best way to get better at drawing is to draw more. pretty much nobody started out good at drawing and it isnt something that happens overnight. there's things that generate a single word for inspiration, or you could think of the first thing that pops into your head for even a moment, and build off it. it doesnt have to be a masterpiece. nobody started out creating masterpieces. when you get the idea down, keep it. later on you might want to remake it when your skill improves, or you can use it as a reminder of how far you've improved. and really *any* idea can be useful in some way for drawinge6 might not be where you put your *practice* art, but you'll get to a point where you meet the standards.

87897	230525	@vex714: You think right.  I totally agree.  It was too tame.  I found his postings sometimes a bit off and risque, but not unlike some of my own.  After seeing his records, I checked my own for the first time.  Not a one.Was he too visible?  	
87896	230525	@tiamat5: Seems like this got a good lot of people talking.  Good.  Interestingly, there's a good amount of opinions on both sides.Mine?  In this day and age, the definition of creepy, and what qualifies as such is becoming increasingly...subjective.

93359	277038	@Mairo: Hi, I have a question about image quality. If there are two identical-looking images, one of them a higher-res .jpg and the other a lower-res .png, which one do I upload?	
79627	277038	@Mairo: Why is my upload (#1494132) deleted for being the inferior version of #1495174 even though these two have the same resolution?	
68328	277084	I wonder if Fireflufferz plans on uploading this abomination to e621.

108728	279820	@NotMeNotYou(or any other relevant mods)Message me if you want to discuss the recently re-done cheese grater. Based on your current upload guidelines and definitions, I do not believe a derivative work of the nature violates any existing rules.	
84429	279820	Is it ok to tag mount/rider_relations where there's nothing actually happening, but it's heavily implied?e.g. post #1352743Probably 99% of everything in the tag involves at least physical contact currently.	
118267	319936	What if we held hands in the e621 badlands?

83973	279820	@FoxyBomb: Yeah wow, this R34 influx sure has spammed up the scalie tag with things that definitely don't have scales. Maybe koopa should be de-implied?	
83903	279820	@DiceLovesBeingBlown: Just happened to click on the tag history there and gotta say, your tagging on that post deserves a positive record all on its own. Or at least recognition in the Jedi archives.	
83705	279820	Lance Armstrong said:>chapter 917Did they find the treasure yet	
83268	279820	That's probably legitimate for that post, though. There's only a few joke tags that have regular use, everything else just gets removed later.But otherwise I agree the comments were really vanilla	
81878	279820	@W0LFB3AT5: Haggling is perfectly legal in the US, though most large retailers are already cut down about as low as they can go for cheap items, so there's no real point to it.With thrift shops you can haggle as much as you want if you're a regular.	
81694	279820	Do we have an unwritten rule as to when an implication should be suggested vs. tagged manually?Noticed in_container has multiple un-implied sub tags, though some only have under 20 uses.	
81443	279820	Randomly noticed the tags 16:9 and 16:10 imply widescreen, though it doesn't seem to actually add the widescreen tag correctly. Did I miss something really obvious or is there a bug here? Does the colon screw it up, possibly?	
79940	279820	Ideally the pop. page would collapse blacklist items & load another x items at the bottom; Could probably toggle a single line '~solo ~solo_focus ~close-up -rating:s' then.Would mainly be a convenience feature; no idea if the code even supports this.	
79939	279820	I sort through some fav species/tags manually every day or so, the popular section is mainly good for catching a few notable things I'd otherwise miss with just these searches. 1/2

70678	279820	Come to think of it, we could really use more phobia/philia tags. Claustrophobia for example can easily be something fetish-related (especially considering the amount of vore stuff we have), though it's barely been used.So, er.. tagging project anyone?	
70673	279820	@W0LFB3AT5: Unsurprisingly, there's a tag for that! trypophobia	
69070	279820	@NotMeNotYou: Was actually going to do an alias suggestion to !sound_warning, so it also sorts to the top of the tooltip/mouseover. Though the site threw an error saying it's already aliased or something(?)

68840	279820	@Chameloshi: Range will be limited by the viscosity of the liquid you're firing, which for LN is pretty low.It's mainly impractical because flammable liquids store more easily and for a lot longer.Also they stick to you, LN tends to bounce off.

68722	279820	@Jugofthat: I've lurked around for probably a year just trying to figure everything out, lol. This place has more learning curve than other furry sites so it's possible most artists don't want to deal with it (especially if someone else does it for you:).

Does this mean that all users are now going to be restricted to a maximum resolution even if they try to use the old ""change submission file"" workaround? I know that the maximum file size has been 10 MB even with the workaround, but restricting the resolution is going to be problematic.

90440	285986	@Versperus: Unfortunately, there are other artists with names starting with Wolfeh and a quick FA user name search shows that Wolfeh is claimed by someone else.

96290	289049	@JX~Enigma If she looks like a pink colored human in the image, she counts as a human for the site. A lot of works of her here either just barely pass as non-human or involve things that do pass ALONGSIDE her so she comes along.	
96023	289049	@Usuario2 If you're talking about post #1930655, the tags were locked because gender was being tagged via outside information, aka not something visible. The character, in this specific context, looks like a girl. Ergo: tagged as such.	
96001	289049	Site issue dealt with; turns out to not be a problem but rather a normal site function (created after the morph tags) possibly clashing with bot activity, causing a loooot of time before things processed. No biggie, we good 👍	
95998	289049	@furballs_dc Yeah, it's just a specific part of the site being a mess, one only janitors and above have to deal with. So yeah, seems like the rest of the site is functioning fine, so no need to worry. Just a pain in the butt for admins rn

95543	289049	@Fatefulbrawl777~ You also need to improve artistically for any of your work to pass. I suggest you keep practicing with art to help yourself improve.	
95540	289049	@Fatefulbrawl777~ Unless the images are high quality (aka look scanned rather than a photo), they don't tend to be accepted here.However, even if properly framed as such, your works aren't of high enough artistic quality/merit to pass	
95535	289049	post #1799301People on here really have no shame about talking unprompted in length about shit and cum and piss and then think the creepy comments rule is censorship.

95458	289049	@French_Fried Not too long ago! Maybe about 5-6 days.	
95456	289049	@ChaozDesignz Posts can be in differing contexts, and she can look like a cat humanoid in some contexts. Also, a lot of old felicia posts are grandfathered in before we implemented the current, stricter human rules.	
95453	289049	@ChaozDesignz The site works on a Tag What You See policy. She may be a catgirl in canon, but in the context of the post she looks like a human in a skimpy cat costume with a fake cat ear hood on as well as a fake tail.

95106	289049	@AdiCordo Yes, tag the character. As for body type color, tag what it looks like. If it looks like skin, then  *_skin. If you can't tell what type of body they have, then *_body works.

83194	295669	@NotMeNotYoumaybe I'M afraid of cucumbers. if someone leaves a comment about how much they love cucumbers can I report it?? it made me feel uneasy, so I guess we need to block them to prevent any further cucumber comments. right??	
83192	295669	"@NotMeNotYouthe very wording of the rules are subjective. ""comments that cause an unpleasant feeling of fear or unease"" how can you determine what constitutes ""fear"" and ""unease""??? ...... {continued in next blip}"	
83189	295669	@notmenotyou and furthermore. how about I go around and flag a couple thousand comments for creepiness. and based on your own logic they WILL be considered creepy and must be dealt with!	
121094	33842	Fritz the Cat at 50: The X-rated cartoon that shocked the US	
83188	295669	@notmenotyou ok, one. I just grabed the first two examples. literally [1] & [2]and two, the rules ARE popularity based. this whole site is a popularity contest. If people don't like you, they're more likely to report your comments.....	
83185	295669	@ratteit is like talking to a brick wall......	
83183	295669	"@ratteso when you say ""bad post"" what you actually mean is a post that legitimately breaks the rules. if ""bad posts"" could be reported and deleted just like ""bad comments"" then don't you think we'd have less cheese graders in assholes on this site?"	
83181	295669	"@ratte and upvotes and downvotes mean nothing when deleting a post. I don't even see how you made that connection. a ""post"" gets deleted if it breaks a site rule. but a comment can be reported by anyone. "	
83179	295669	"@ratte so if I, a user with no authority deem a comment unwanted and report it. then that user will be banned? do you admins even take the time to read the comments? or do you just say ""oh well it got reported so it must be evil. BANNED!""?"	
83177	295669	@rattedon't worry. I already wined to the admin who did. YOU responded to ME. and so if you don't have a horse in this race then why are you defending it so hard?	
83175	295669	"@ratteok fine. forget about the upvotes. who cares. lets look at the subject matter. ""I envy her multitasking skills"" wow. so creepy..""The passion for the girls of Spyro has been...reignited"" oh no, so creepy. block em!"	
83173	295669	Lyrest said:@Autumn-Ferret: I totally agree with you. These ''offenses' are so small and harmless.yes. harmless is exactly the word I would use. how can something so harmless be reason enough for banning???	
83172	295669	@ratte so according to the you, all it takes is one person with a stick up his ass to report a comment and then that user deserves to be banned??? 	
83169	295669	"@tiamat5: this is so unfair. I hate seeing people like you get blocked for nothing. how can it be considered ""creepy comments"" if you got a ton of upvotes on them? people on this site need to grow up."

105697	29694	Damn, haven't seen furry fandom drama this juicy in a good while, need to get some popcorn.	
104527	29694	Late to the party, but damn, that Upload page is a mess at the moment; And no Quick tags?	
104284	29694	To end my own whining, was it ever stated why the site had to undergo this change? Something wrong or incompatible with the old E6?	
104238	29694	@CCoyote: No doubt, just seems a bit half-baked, and unprompted.	
104220	29694	Is it a bug or did the new update nuke some posts? Went from 7000 to 5800 posts, and doesn't seem like they were deleted.	
103331	29694	@HoboAssassin: Haha, thanks. Just trying to keep the score even as posts are deleted due to higher resolution uploads and takedowns.

95131	29694	That was an annoying thread to read through. Like watching a video of a group of people arguing with a brick wall with no ears and an angry mouth.

84001	29694	@Mairo: Community seems pretty decent at patching up any uploading holes created by banning prolific users. Besides, think banning him is good in the long-term since ya won't have to fix upscaled posts, and shite like that.

77249	29694	@Queen_Tyr'ahnee: Dunno how I'd add that to the exception. I'd add -making_fun_of_communism to the line in my blacklist, but it doesn't exist; Or maybe that's capitalism, if that tag exists.

76932	29694	@Commander_Eggplant: Ye, that is what I thought, just had a memory of some thread about chicks with cum in their cunts counting as straight, same with cum in a dudes ass, and gay.	
76909	29694	I've forgotten, is cum inside an orifice enough to go on when tagging sexuality? IIRC last time it was brought up in the forums the answer was no.	
76879	29694	I must be very out of touch, I thought lol_comments for the most part was about funny comment chains, not spergy furries yelling at each other over things that don't matter in the slightest.	
76818	29694	I am very against penis_vein being aliased to veiny_penis, but not enough to create a forum thread about it. Loud noises.	
76725	29694	Fuck yeah, Go Faze!	
76445	29694	@Chameloshi: Neato, meanwhile it's storming here in Sweden. Not the good, cold, snowy type of storm; Trees being blown over and constant rain type of storm. Water in Sweden and Snow in Texas, sounds about right.	
76385	29694	I decided to quit shaving for a few weeks, for the first time in years, to see whether my facial hair growth had gotten any better. Can't decide if it makes me look like a playboy from the 70's or a pedophile from a 90's PSA. Probably both.

86464	327845	No, when there was no visual difference, I don't think it is at all necessary to repost the entire contents of the tag, I personally think he is just doing it just so he can say he is now the uploader.	
86463	327845	Well there isnt a need for replacement so...... And nobody but you and him think he's doing an amazing job. The only amazing job he is doing, is fucking up the continuity of the tag.

98423	341241	@Odisaodi : I don't know yet. Seems kinda useless to me as with this you go to FA to grab the image and then search e6 for similar ones, not the other way around.	
98295	341241	@Odisaodi Still no upload but I added more features! https://streamable.com/j7im8I need to conceptualize the design and technicalities for it and then if I spend tomorrow on writing it, it should be ready for some alpha testing. # there is just 4 testin	
98135	341241	@Odisaodi SO I think this part is done https://streamable.com/pjzmoEdit: actually not, now that I look at it there are two more bugs and one feature I forgot. But after that I think it's time for upload function.	
98102	341241	@Odisaodi : It's CefSharp, it's that white windows. Buttons and rest of the stuff you make on your own. IE is just too old now, works ok on most websites but microsoft should replace it already.	
98064	341241	@Odisaodi https://streamable.com/2ee6j So yeah, I'm fixing bugs from that video first. I almost have it decently working, still no upload or anything though.	
97884	341241	@Odisaodi : Ok, so it's basically working now as far as the scrapping department goes.Two days of nonstop working on it and I haven't even put any new features in yet, but it should pick up from now. Most of the hard and iffy bug stuff is done,so, soon™

85730	341241	@Ratte, (Bulk) upload speed has no relation to tagging speed.This damn thing just making me paranoid and scared of uploading.

85710	341241	Like,if you upload 100+ and dont tag a few properly,like 1% and less.It shd be counted as honest mistake not Abuse/VandalismRules broken I get it but Idnt think that should get u perm ban for a mistak that didnt do much damage compard to other broke r

100552	353987	@NotMeNotYou: What's up, opinion Nazi?	
100082	353987	@NotMeNotYou: Mr. NotMeNotYou, let me ask you this, why are we pandering to the weakest members of our community who can't tolerate free speech of others? Why is this not their owm personal problem to deal with? Who gave them these privileges? 	
100080	353987	@kahen_kilon_vittu: You think i give a shit about this site lol... it's a dystopian wasteland void of any kind of speech, be it positive or negative. 	
100077	353987	@CCoyote: what's creepy about saying what 100% of people are thinking? So why are you prowling this site if you don't emerse yourself into the situations? That's creepier to be here for no reason. You don't even post. You just lurk in the shadows. 	
100076	353987	@Retsasidsavb: You can't say anything here without offending everyone. You can't just say what comes naturally, you have to follow a template. What's the point	
100075	353987	"@NotMeNotYou: Your avatar says, ""Stop taking the internet so seriously"", yet you admins bully and shame me for no reason, give me false ratings, then accuse me of harassment for questioning it. You are speech Nazis. Fuck yourself."

123369	35483	@somethingedgey: Neutral records can be removed after 6 months.  In general, records can decay in 6-month chunks (suspension to negative to neutral to deletion) but it's not automatic, so ask staff for removal (or decay, if it comes to that) when it's time.	
123174	35483	so much for leaving huh	
122906	35483	@But_Why_Master: Your last post was a 680x571 small-view twitter jpeg while the updated post is a 1010x848 png from FA and other png-friendly sources.  Any jpg will have compression, that's how they work.  If you're curious, this is what it looks like to apply 'difference' to both images (using the full-size twitter jpeg and the FA png) to see where those differences are, exactly.  All of that 'fuzz' is from jpeg compression artifacting.

119165	35483	@Gusta_Cz: Twitter is unfortunately not a great place for artists since it's very fast and fleeting, and generally not designed with art in mind.  We're unfortunately at a point where there isn't really any good place for art anymore, as FA is so full of ad spam that people have left and gone to Twitter which has the aforementioned issues.  There has yet to be a decent alternative, but try not to focus too much on reception on sites not meant for the way you use it or you'll be terminally disappointed.

84742	366626	Is there a way to update and merge images? Like you upload an image but then later you find a bigger version of said a image you uploaded and then the newer upload gets merged with the the old copy of said image and all the favs + tags get carried over.

126346	370094	"The Amen break is a drum break that has been widely sampled in popular music. It comes from the 1969 track ""Amen, Brother"" by the American soul group the Winstons, released as the B-side of the 1969 single ""Color Him Father"". The drum break lasts seven seconds and was performed by Gregory Coleman."	
126338	370094	The switches and control knobs have several functions, so operating the TB-303 may seem a little complicated. You may find difficulty using the TB-303 at first, because it is so different from a Bass Guitar or a keyboard instrument. Therefore, this manual includes a Basic, Intermediate and Advanced Course to help you understand these operations, step by step. However, each individual operation is quite simple, so take your time and master each step.

126315	370094	A musical bass line involves many complex factors, such as different pitches and beats, and consequently it is a difficult thing to reproduce automatically. It may vary depending on the rhythm, chord progression, style of music and the character of the musician. Sometimes it can take the role of a low melody, then it might outline the chords or become a strong rhythmic influence in an ensemble. But overall it is a very important part of the rhythm section, following the chord progression, mainly using the root and fifth note.

119358	384004	"@garfieldfromgarfield: My personal philosophy is that, if the artist has a couple pieces already uploaded, then someone probably asked for permission at some point and I shouldn't bother them by asking again. But if the artist has zero/only one or two uploads, I send them a message and ask first. In this case, I can also recommend doing a search for the artist's name along with status:deleted, to see if they have any previously deleted works which follow a pattern to avoid (and obviously checking the Avoid Posting List ).I definitely believe this puts me in the minority though, and that most people work on a ""post now, delete later"" principle. Though I can say that from my personal experience with two separate artists (monstrifex and unixcat) that they were both very open to me posting their content (and having the affirmation was also a great way to alleviate the uncertainty you're describing)."

80616	38560	I redrew scenes in the comic to act as single keyframes in what is essentially a 750-800 frame-long animation with about 725-775 of those frames being unique. I was wondering if those redrawn keyframes would turn the animation into DNP.	
80604	38560	If I make an animation that has keyframes based directly on a comic made by an artist that is on the avoid posting list, but consists of about 80% original frames and poses, should I still avoid posting it?

114650	38571	@Odisaodi: You do get additional stuff like larger storage, more ram, faster processor, higher quality camera, features like underscreen fingerprint scanner and 5G. Phones are computers, so it scales pretty similarly to something like laptop or prebuild desktop - faster and larger components and more features. Like 10 years ago, buying low-mid tier phone would get you into so many bottlenecks that you would want to throw the phone out the window when there's not enough space to even install discord and browser would lag opening new tab, but nowdays, even low-mid tier stuff is more than useable. I got myself ROG phone 5. Reasonings are that it has enough specs to run everything I want to run on it, triggers on phone itself and game overlay with useful features, headphone jack with front facing super loud stereo speakers, flat screen with no notches or holepunches, battery that lasts for two days, enough space for everything, etc. etc. and also money wasn't an issue.

106578	38571	@Jakku_NoShi: I mean, that, paheal, danbooru, etc. all are boorus or image boards and operate in more or less similar fashion. (Not because of same software, but because of crowdsourcing and indexing nature) e621 does allow and even encourage artists to post (hence why we don't have such straighforward message anywhere), but the point is that when you do post your own stuff, rules and guidelines can hit you in the face much more than they would anyone else when they aren't aligned. Additionally staff can't make exceptions every single time it's artist posting or waste hours on responding to passive aggressive blips and dmails about how they somehow have personal vendetta againts artist and how artist will now full on quit because of them. I think derpibooru doesn't have quality standards as they are all about that friendship and allowed all and every content, but after some time I think they did enforce some rules of stuff needing to be pony related in some fashion now.

105717	38571	@Samael_Morningstar: one of the cases of porn doesn't equal reality, because it looks nice and hot in pornography. Don't have statistics, but I'm fairly certain that most guys cannot ejaculate from anal stimulus alone, some don't even get hardon and with big toys it's actually easier to keep it flaccid. You can try to massage prostate specifically, some can even get multiple handsfree orgasms with prostate stimulators, but even that's down to individuals and many can't do that. Anal can still be enhancement, just practise good reach around and fellatio with your partner if they can't hands-free.

Your new laptop doesn't effect the counter on a website. Additionally your upload counter was nuked on purpose, because you were uploading material clearly againts the guidelines, then proceed to top it off with clearly maliciously made upload. Uploading guidelines are linked clearly and all uploads are handled MANUALLY by staff, so you uploading text on image is only going to take time away from other stuff that would need it more.

104352	38571	@anime52: Use tags date: for exact date or age: for determining how old posts you want to see, combine with order:score or order:favcount depending on which one you want to utilize to determine what's popular (I prefer favcount as it's more accurate, popular page uses votes aka score). If you want the most popular from last couple days, use order:rank only. Then just add in other tags you might want to use on top of that, e.g. -female if you do not want to see females on the list. The limit has been raised from 6 to 40.

Also popular was full of only handful of vanilla stuff, solo females with visible bits with exact cutoff, so it was only useful for those who are into that vanilla stuff and females. It's replaced with ""hot"" aka order:rank which instead of using exact day seperation uses posts age instead and can be used in combination of other tags.

123675	408179	garfieldfromgarfield said:How do I link an alias/implication to an already existing forum post? I don't want to clog the catalogue by creating an unnecessary thread when I can just tack one onto the other.You can put a BUR in an existing forum thread/topic by getting the forum topic number (which you can see in the URL following the /forum_topics/, for instance 39906 for your latest topic ), then put that number in the Forum topic field at the bottom of the request page. You can't do it for a normal non-BUR alias or implication requests, though.

Is there a policy on that?Yes, and yes:AI Generated content: No AI generated, or AI assisted artwork.Exceptions are currently for backgrounds (treated like using a photo as a background, quality rules apply); for artwork that references, but does not directly use, AI generated content; and for full paintovers.	
121608	408179	Shaski said:damn, i kinda do wonder if you can reupload a post that only got deleted cuz it didn't get exactly reviewed and approved lol, not exactly feeling like breaking rules 😇No, you can't reupload a post that was deleted. If you think it was deleted in error (didn't get approved in time, or for an invalid reason), you can dmail either NotMeNotYou or the moderator that deleted it asking to have undeleted, with reasons why you think it was incorrectly deleted.	
121518	408179	I can't help but notice a surprising number of compromised accounts these last few days. Are these people just using really weak passwords or something?	
121175	408179	Good job, FA. New update only uses approximately 2/3rds of my screen width, causing wider images to be visibly shrunk despite having plenty of screen space to view it full size.	
121169	408179	"Alien_Fluff said:So yeah, why a resolution restriction instead of a file size restriction?I wonder how that's going to work. Previously/currently there's a restriction of 1280p in either direction, so it's shrunk to make the larger dimension fit; for ""QHD""/2650x1440, does that mean the maximum height is increased by only 160 pixels taller, while the maximum width is 1370 pixels wider? So even a 1500x1500 image is still going to get scrunched, which really screws over comics more than normal widescreen images. Or is it total pixel count, so 1440x2650, 1920x1920, etc, fits? Hardly great either way, I know artists that regularly surpass even 3840x2160, but if they can't handle even 1500x1500, that's such a measly difference from the current 1280p limit that I have to ask, what's the point of the ""upgrade""? Besides, if the issues us storage space, a 1K PNG can easily be larger than a 4K JPG."	
121133	408179	Lance_Armstrong said:Does update tag -> tag2 in a BUR keep its category?How is it different from alias tag -> tag2?1. Not sure2. An update is a one-time change (all current uses of tag will be changed to tag2, but you can still add tag to posts afterward), while an alias changes all current and future uses.

I didn't even know it was a thing initially (I didn't see any announcement for it, and Youtube didn't show it as a recommendation until a few days after the first episode was released, despite their AI knowing I'd be interested), but it's really quite good and should get more recognition. Quite short though, it seems it's only three episodes.

Every. Page. And worse, if I try to click on clickable from a Twitter page to go to another one (including clicking an image to see it embiggened), it pops up that nagging ""Log in or Register"" thing again, but this time clicking the X to dismiss it also makes the page go back, so it won't let me see the thing I tried to click on, no matter what it is. The only way around that is to open links in a new tab (for links that can be opened in a new tab, at least); that page will still get the nagging popup, but clicking the X to dismiss it leaves me on the page that way."

My best guess is it does unnecessarily stupid things to dynamically load links in the active page, rather than proper page-to-page linking, preventing the browser from reclaiming resources from the pages you've moved away from. Opening links in new tabs and closing the old ones can help, but that's less than ideal.

114256	408179	Lance_Armstrong said:I got it too. Much easier to click a button than solve a CAPTCHA.Unfortunately it throws you to the front page after clicking, instead of continuing to the page you were trying to go to. It also causes uploading, replying, and editing to fail. As bad as CAPTCHAs are, I've run into it far less and it's never done that.

111399	408179	Millcore said:Does anyone know of some gryphon artists? I've been looking around for a friend, nsfw or sfw is fine, they want a lot of detail and don't worry about price. Preferably not DNP. Red-Izak does a good amount of detailed gryphons, both SFW and NSFW. Nambroth has also done some gryphons, though only SFW (and while not DNP, they do state they don't want their work reposted without explicit permission, so could end up getting taken down without it).	
109110	408179	"G0wther said:Someone (maybe one who is a total horn ball) want to explain this to me? I'd be greatful to know how this works to better understand you normal people.Similar to someone ""thinking with one's dick"". Someone's horniness drives them to make impulsive, irrational decisions in an attempt to release their sexual frustration/tension, and after an orgasm helps release that tension and provides an endorphin rush, they're more calm, less impulsive, and can think more rationally. I can't say I've experienced this to any significant degree, I think in art and fiction it's played up for the fantasy/fetish aspect of being extremely horny, but ""post nut regret"" is a real thing that can sometimes happens to men, women, or anyone."

108768	408179	MONSTER HUNTER - Official Trailer (HD)People seem to think this is the devil incarnate. Not that I'm expecting it to be high cinema or anything, but it looks good visually, the monsters look great, the action seems to be fine so far, and I'm a bit of a sucker for normal-humans-forced-into-fantasy-worlds (or fantasy creatures/monsters appearing in the real world) type stories. I don't expect the plot to blow me away, or for the characters to be particularly well fleshed out, but I don't think Monster Hunter was particularly strong with those things to begin with. I'm optimistic it'll be an enjoyable watch, even if it's not the movie that the game's fans seem to want.

This only gets more severe later on in Ready Player Two, when the protagonist releases a brain interface that allows full-dives.Another book called The Unincorporated Man (which is set in a minarchist, ultra-capitalistic society 300 years in the future) has VR as one of the few things the government outright bans.(I should note that I have a lot of problems with all three of these books and liking this one specific aspect doesn't necessarily mean I like every other aspect.)Sword Art Online sucks.

I have a family member going through major health problems and a life of alcoholism has made it much, much worse for him. I'm not really close with him, but I do think this is worth learning from. A fucked liver is not fun to have.

125470	47475	Since the mid-to-late 2010s, vehicles have been so loaded up with nanny gear that is meant to keep us safe (it is really allowing for bad driving habits to flourish), and with so much 'connectivity' and shiny things (allowing for further bad driving habits to flourish) the prospect of new car ownership is both super cool, and super frightening.All of the shiny whiz bang is going to fail and break, and once that 3 or 4 year warranty is up, it is going to cost you soooooo much money to fix.   I like older cars because they were more simple, and did not need to go to the dealership for *everything*Now, sadly, as great as they are (were), they are just getting old, worn out, rusted out, and just plain busted.  Like me, it would seem. 	
125468	47475	@Kemonophonic: If the full embracing of the CVT was not bad enough, I see now that most Subaru models have not only EGR emissions systems, but they are water-cooled EGR systems. The system that when not sucking away power due to carbon deposits (as Subaru has not yet addressed the shortcomings of direct injection, and are running badly out of date crankcase ventilation systems), it is turning your engine into a Frosty machine, as it begins pumping coolant backwards into your engine when the (plastic and aluminum) water-to-exhaust heat exchanger fails. At least the newer engines have exchanged head gasket failures with only timing cover leaks.  And CVT leaks.  And extreme carbon problems; when I (briefly) worked @ Subaru, we saw vehicles with barely 10K on the clock coming in with flashing CEL because of deposit induced misfire, needing combustion cleaning before even a 2nd oil change.  	
125467	47475	@Kemonophonic: I am very much saddened by how far Subaru has fallen, or perhaps failed in keeping up.  Their styling has gotten bland (I swear the WRX rear was lifted from a Civic, and a bland Civic at that), and with all tactile buttons and switches replaced by a giant idiotic tablet in the middle of the dash.  The giant idiotic tablet in the middle of the dash that often lags, freezes, or just plain fails to start.  The giant idiotic tablet that hides the auto-stop override like 3 menus deep  :|  Almost every other car company (even Honda) has realizes this failing, and has reintroduced some tactile knobs and switches.

I'm not sure I'd be very good at teaching you anything ^^;I'm not familiar with that technique. Usually when I palm mute I'm muting the strings that I'm playing, not the ones I'm not playing.When you're playing on your highest string, then, how do you keep the lower strings from ringing? I guess most pick players use their fretting-hand thumb for the lowest string or two but that's not really feasible to mute the D string when you're playing on the G... or if you have more than 4 strings...People say ""just rest the side of your picking hand on them"" or something like that, like it should be easy, but I haven't gotten the hang of it."	
114754	68974	Kemonophonic said:New guitar picks!Do you pick bass, too?If so, can you teach me? :vI haven't been able to get how you're supposed to mute open strings with the picking hand without also muting the string you're playing.

No, this is never practiced. We have a sense given us by nature to distinguish whether the cook acted according to the rules of his art. People taste the ragoo, and tho’ unacquainted with those rules, they are able to tell whether it be good or no.

It comes from the 1969 track ""Amen, Brother"" by the American soul group the Winstons, released as the B-side of the 1969 single ""Color Him Father"". The drum break lasts seven seconds and was performed by Gregory Coleman.It’s truly a tragedy that he was unable to receive any royalties from his own drum break as the band didn’t know about the sampling until 1996, and their music was just outside of the statue of limitations for copyright. Coleman passed away homeless in 2006."

A herniated disc or sciatica would’ve been a hell of a lot worse than a simple sprain. Also, it would’ve last months- maybe years to recover from that. Had to do some physical therapy to help relieve some of the pain for a few days. Doc said I’ll be able to recover next week after taking medication. Maybe early later on since I can fully walk now. I can finally unclench from worry now. :D Thanks again guys for wishing me well.  Woah, that's good to hear. Though a sprain isn't optimal, at least it is better than the other options and knowing what it is will ease the worry.

97604	78799	@Honnii: The pixels on your screen are unable to be underage, traumatized, or have any real feelings.It's not worth getting bent out of shape over fiction. You don't even have to see the drawings if you don't want to. Just blacklist them and move on.	
97223	78799	Ever just look back at some of your blips and comments and see dumb grammar mistakes you wish you could fix?	
97204	78799	@Odisaodi: Congrats on your new shiny new green bar!	
97005	78799	@crybThey didn't give you a record for asking for your art to not be reposted, they gave it to you because you threatened to kill people and gouge their eyes out.I feel there were better ways to go about that.

95994	78799	The hourly tagging limit is such a cockblock sometimes.	
95376	78799	@vaelophis_nyx: The tags are there for searching and blacklisting things by what appears to be in any given image.No one is trying to attack people's identities, characters, or art. We're trying to archive them in an easily-searchable manner.	
95149	78799	@MissChu: Congrats on the green mark! You seem to be doing a lot of good work cleaning up the tags.

94157	78799	@NinosieWell this was a weird thing to stumble upon.Never know what you'll find searching your name in the user list.	
94136	78799	@ClearAbuseOfPower: That was quite a meltdown.Some people love to cry abuse just because someone in power made a decision that they don't agree with.TWYS has its flaws, but it's better than any alternative I can think of for an image archive.

80945	78812	@Whygena: Hi! Sorry to hear about your issues with e621's tagging. I've had the same problem. Character sex is the single most common (if not only) major conflict with the Tag What You See system and they definitely need a new protocol for it. Take care!

125024	80537	"Daleport996 said:How did you even discover this? I guess 600kb is pretty big for a jpg that size, so you might've decided to look deeper. But how did you even get the video out of that?The description on source mentioned Steve Irwin. Maybe the clip was from one of his shows?Here are some of the frames I could see by pausing but it only lasts for like a second https://imgur.com/a/FXWxWbK along with some audio that sounds like a male voice saying ""do what"" As to the how one of the things I like to do as a weird hobby is look at random data that's been added onto the end of files. I've got a python script that can scan pictures and saves any data that's been appended to the end of jpg png or gif files. Most of the time it's boring but sometimes I find artists comments, meme copy pasta, and other oddities like https://e621.net/tickets/47183 way back when people use to add random files to stuff. thankfully that's not much of an issue anymore."	
125022	80537	Found a weird Easter egg on post #2501278. There's about 605kb of data after the picture data ends and it seems to be a video clip of some movie or tv show. The issue is I can only get a few frames of it before it stops.

74118	86655	@Mario69: Hey, wondering why my post is getting deleted by you? The first message i had was 'unsuitable for site (non-human)' meaning the site isnt meant for things that arent human, which is... wrong? or it means she is human, which she isnt. 	
4219	87096	Well anyway, I've been home for a while now, so I don't have to worry about that happening again, or do I?..	
4218	87096	blacktemberwolf said:are you scared now because he/she was sleeping with you 0-0... Not quite, I'm scared because I don't know what he was doing that got his pants on my bed in the first place...	
3821	87096	-where, within ten seconds, I find my roommate's key in his pants, that were on my bed... randomly.And then, the rest of the day happened...	
3820	87096	I decide to go to management-thank god I always bring an extra change of clothes with meThe good people of management (who know me well for having this kind of a problem, I mean, I honestly think that I'm too trusting) let me back into my room	
3819	87096	I (for the life of me, why?) say yes-but I tell him that he has to bring the key back to me after he finishes opening the door, regardless of whether or not he finds his keyI finish my shower-twenty minutes pass by	
3818	87096	Here's a little something from my day:My roommate goes to take a shower-forgets keyHe asks me if he can borrow mine-while I'm in the shower	
3817	87096	I... HATE... HOT... BLOODYFREAKIN'HUMID... WEATHER!!!So now that I'm no longer exploring that oven of a room for eight hours a day, I will now proceed to basement dwell for the next week.	
2157	87096	Have you ever played the Prime series, the arm cannon is built around Samus' arm, and can be removed separately from the rest of the power suit (but Kirby doesn't have the will of the chozo God of War, so he probably can't do that...)	
2095	87096	XxShrikexX said:Careful now, we don't want you shooting stars out of you mouth.I'm not that wasteful, I'll just press down (hope it comes with the helmet!)

2020	87096	Xch3l said:@IVK:Probaly you ate Samus and she's trying to escapeWell, the standard procedure for escaping from the bowels of anything in that series seems to be morphball bombs, sooo it's only logical... I guess?	
2016	87096	(It still isn't the strangest noise I've heard come from my stomach, that title would have to go to the gut dubstep bowel movement. Issa pun, get it?)	
2015	87096	Should I be worried, my stomach just grumbled, but it wasn't like a normal grumble, it made the Samus Aran morphball bomb noise (the one it makes in melee.) I'm currently very confused, and would like someones opinion as soon as possible, thanks!

1875	87096	If your wondering, I was bored, so I am watching porn, and I am folding lingerie, but I'm not actually fapping, I kinda find it a bit pointless... :/	
1874	87096	You know you've got control over you body when you can watch porn, fold lingerie, and not even consider fapping at any point... *fap!* *fap!* *fap!* Godamnit!

1834	87096	So, about an hour ago, I hit a tree while biking... That makes two today. (The other was with an inner-tube.)

1740	87096	GOD DAMMIT! I've had the song 'Heartbreaker' stuck in my head for three days STRAIGHT now. I even hear it in my dreams! I just can't fucking take this anymore!!!	
1700	87096	IVK said:A story of some importance.I still have no idea what she said to her son. I feel sorry for her, her son, and, of course, the rabbit.	
1699	87096	So, the other day, my cousin told me that she had accidentally killed her son's pet rabbit. We both freaked out because we didn't know what to do about it... To be quite honest; we were scared as fuck!	
1698	87096	"furballs dc said:""Gearbox 'embezzled' Aliens: Colonial Marines money""And to believe that I nearly accepted their offer to test the game... Yeah, with all the controversy, I kinda didn't expect much from it."	
1542	87096	furballs dc said:Huh. So there is r34 of it after all.I think I just went into the catatonic state known better as the facepalm.

1540	87096	I think it's just how wikipedia's set up (and how he effected the world.) It's kind of scary that he has at least a six degree relevance to everything on wikipedia.	
1538	87096	I've found that I could do that with every page I started out with. The easiest one was when I hit random, and it took me directly to the Hitler wikipedia page.	
1537	87096	It's something to kill time with when you're bored.	
1536	87096	If not, then you needn't worry! The criteria for the game are rather simple; you simply start on a random wikipedia page, and by only using the links listed within the wikipedia pages, find the Hitler wikipedia page within six clicks.	
1535	87096	Does anyone know what the Hitler wikipedia game is?	
1534	87096	furballs dc said:How it works.Lol.

68190	87359	Oops, forgot to add there is more content as well:kemono, vore, dragonXhuman, and some gay stuff :P (still everything is awesome and has a cute style)

5993	89061	So how would one say upload a video from say Youtube to the site? Do you have to convert it to a certain format?

9499	87359	I kind of think the Avoid Posting List should me more direct to the user, for example like in the upload interface. >_> ...Lame... I lost all the work on that comic pool ;__; (which I didn't start, but didn't realize of DNP and stuff).

(fwiw i'm at least familiar enough with god's pee and swans' catalog to have a backlog for them)Post-rock is less of a genre and more of an ethos like punk. Each band sounds different in their own very distinct ways. Just letting you know.Mogwai - Young Team Talk Talk - Laughing StockSlint - SpiderlandSigur Rós - Ágætis ByrjunExplosions in the Sky - The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead PlaceSilver Mt. Zion - He Has Left Us Alone but Shafts of Light Sometimes Grace the Corner of Our Rooms...Personally not the biggest fan of the last two but you be your own judge.	
124887	973967	Any post-rock recs? Give me artists other than slint, gy!be, talk talk, swans, sigur ros, explosions in the sky, silver mt zion and mogwai.
