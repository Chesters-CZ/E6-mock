This Tumblr account has now been dedicated to housing Eros comic updates, so while the Hub for my art is now at www.cobaltsnow.squarespace.com I want to utilize Tumblr’s simple posting and sharing (and community) capabilities to help Eros grow as an independent web comic.

Updates will begin shortly, and will most likely speed up when I have a little more time on my hands. As some of you who pay attention to my more prominent blog will most likely know that I am in the middle of a transition period at the moment (a little hard to explain) the point is that I’ll get a lot more free time on my hands in a short time, and you’ll see a lot more from me ^^

Praise Eros.

After inviting some girls over phone, she also sends some invitations with Penny to school. Being so shy, Penny doesn't really look around the classroom often and while she does know this other girl, she isn't completely sure where she sits. Obviously, she got the wrong desk. But that doesn't seem to bother Dimitri much :3

17166	Cock_Dogs	What started as a harmless joke on the Pie farm, resulted in a cultural and culinary revolution for the ponies of Equestria. After a few experiments and reports made their way to Princess Celestia, ponies yearned to try this new form of dong shaped delights. Soon, mare meat was in high demand across the land (and in pony's dreams) which led to the establishment of Equestria's breeding program for futa mares that had already donated their bits to somepony's stomach.

If you'd like to support me I'd really appreciate it if you would buy me a coffee. I'll be seeing about alternatives to Patreon in the future, since I'm not interested in doing business with them anymore, as well, but for now Ko-fi is all I've got in terms of donations.

Late at night in the middle of the woods, a mother and her daughter's carriage has broken down after a long venture from town. Abandoning the carriage used to transport their goods, the two start making their way on foot. As the two continued down the dark path, they couldn't help but feel they were being watched. Even though the moonlight lit their path, it was almost impossible to see passed the fringes of the road. After a while, the two grew tired from their trek, but took solace in knowing they were not far from their farm. A loud reverberating howl echoed from the woods, and suddenly, a massive figure charged at the two. The daughter ran, taking refuge behind a tree, and looked back to find the beast had pinned her mother. The moonlight continued to shine down on the struggle taking place on the road, illuminating a large wolf like beast with two heads ripping the middle aged woman's clothes from her generously proportioned body. The two headed beast was panting with need, their large member both erect and oozing cum while the woman shrieked and clamored."

NOTE FROM ""Hunter 495"":https://e621.net/users/522819 (Not the one who made this pool, that's ""Ash42"":https://e621.net/users/643681) You'd probably want to use a set to make this rather than a pool, as a pool shows up at the top of a page, anyone can edit it, and is more for comics/mangas or sequences, and a set is more of a personal collection, which while still public, can't be seen from a post (aside from a list of sets in the bottom left (or very bottom on mobile)) can't be seen, and can only be edited if someone makes an invite for you.

32780	Reading_lessons_(by_DocFurPanic)	"[i](Script and Story by Prince_Borgon)[/i]

One of the many things that make Prince Borgon an eccentric ruler is the fact that, contrary to all common logic, the outer walls gate looks usually open during the night.

Obviously at the same time the gates and the doors of the castle are all well closed,
but with the right equipment it's possible to climb one of the red sandstone walls and access the interior easily.

There are those who would consider this conduct a defense defect, but for the Prince of Valmeridia it's pure and simple courtesy.
He knows how important it is for his subjects to be able to count on his presence night and day.

And on the other hand, if the thieves knew of the existence of a certaom vigilant guardian, who watches over the prince day and night,
they would probably be careful not to even think of being able to enter the castle undisturbed and steal something precious under his mustache.

Still, there's one creature in particular that just doesn't seem to be learning its lesson.


Skaarly the kobold is on his fifth attempt this month.
He now knows almost every access route to the castle, through windows, spiers and even some secret passages.
He's got it into his head that castle della Verbena hides a great secret, made up of mountains of gold, precious jewels and priceless relics.

He comes from the wild lands of the north, although he must have recently moved permanently among the trees of the great forest of Valmeridia, judging by the frequency of his attacks.


Until now, none of his attempts have ever resulted in anything good.
He was always discovered pretty easily, and accompanied to the door or invited to stay by the good prince.

That night, in particular, while Borgon is intent on spending one of the many endless nights at the castle, a clang of metal echoes through the corridors of the castle.
Sir Cordiale had previously warned the prince of the unexpected guest, and had proposed this time to send him away in a bad way.


But, as we know, Borgon really doesn't like the use of violence, even when it's lawful.
And so, very calmly, he in turn makes his way through the corridors, ready to do ""Olly olly oxen free"" to the little thief caught in the act.

Skaarly soon finds himself with no way out, and unafraid of the prince mumbles something about his nature as an evil lord.


But the dragon is not intimidated at all, rather he is perplexed by Skaarly's words.
And so, the kobold can't even read the signs that warn visitors to behave themselves at the castle?

This is definitely an important matter, one that Borgon wants to resolve immediately.
And since Skaarly is still there and the night is long,
who knows if the prince can't improvise himself as a teacher and give the little kobold thief some [b]special[/b] reading lessons?"
