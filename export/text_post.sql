So even a 1500x1500 image is still going to get scrunched, which really screws over comics more than normal widescreen images. Or is it total pixel count, so 1440x2650, 1920x1920, etc, fits? Hardly great either way, I know artists that regularly surpass even 3840x2160, but if they can''t handle even 1500x1500, that''s such a measly difference from the current 1280p limit that I have to ask, what''s the point of the "upgrade"?
